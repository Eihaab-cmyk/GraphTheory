5 Truths About Marketing I Wish Every Business Owner Knew | by Victoria Alex | VIZZUELL | MediumOpen in appSign upSign inWriteSign upSign in5 Truths About Marketing I Wish Every Business Owner KnewAs a business owner, you have no choice but wear many hats, especially at the beginning. To wear the marketing one in style, read this.Victoria Alex·FollowPublished inVIZZUELL·7 min read·Oct 10, 2023--52ListenShareInstead of introductionYou may wonder, Why “wish”?Let me explain.There are two main reasons.1. The first one is backed up by self-interest.I have studied Economics, after all. (If you don’t get the joke, go read about the “invisible hand”. I am funny.)Marketers’ lives will be way easier when more entrepreneurs embrace these truths. Here I count on all the marketers to “Share, Like, and Subscribe”. I do work for your greater good.2. It will save entrepreneurs so much hustle trying to fix mistakes that can be easily avoided.I understand not every business owner has a marketing background. It is normal. Let’s trust the universe to make them stumble across this article and help them save time and money. Ah, and headache as well.And here are my universal marketing truths:Posting on Facebook is not marketing(Neither is posting on Instagram, TikTok, or Medium… consider any other social media platform included in this example)While we are on the subject of Facebook, I will take a minute to share a few more specific examples of that channel.Facebook is one of the most mature social media platforms. Chances are when you say social media marketing, you actually mean, “I want to grow on Facebook”. It is that popular. Looks like every company has to be there. Even though the organic reach of business profile posts on the platform is around 1%.Consider this: over 300 million photos get uploaded on Facebook per day.Do you believe that a single post of yours stands a chance? Be logical.These facts alone should have discouraged you from believing that a sporadic post on social media can lead to business success. Have I managed to convince you yet? If not, give me one more try.Likes and followers won’t convert into real currency unless you have a solid strategy for how to do it. You are doomed without a strategy.A social media marketing strategy doesn’t start with a post. It starts way back with nailing down your customer’s persona.This will give you information on which social platforms this person frequents. What are their interests, and what they care about. Consider these two points:Different people use different platformsDifferent platforms call for different contentAnswer these questions:Who are the platform users vs what is your product?Do you need to be there?Are your posts backed up by research? Or are they off top of your head?Is the post part of a bigger system that can consistently generate content?Armed with all this information you can now build the whole strategy. And distribute your efforts between the platforms.Choose which forms of content would be appropriate for each platform.A staggering number of people recycle content from a platform to another without even the slightest change. If your marketing guru is doing this, fire them. Right now. Imagine me posting my Facebook post on Medium. Seriously?!The logo is not the brandThe logo is an important part of branding. But the logo is not the brand.Let me give you an AI example. I have heard AI talks are hot nowadays. Now that I have secured my views, reads, engagements, and all, here is the example.You open Fotor or something. You type in what kind of person you want to see. And…bam, you have a picture. Of a person.I need a picture of an Eastern European woman = I need a logo for a hair salon.But who is this person? How do they think? What are their values, beliefs, motives and desires? What keeps them up at night? How do they take their coffee, or maybe they don’t even drink coffee? You got the point.This person does not exist out of this picture. So does your brand, if it is only a logo.I don’t want this article to be a lesson on branding, so I will stop here. Just have it in mind. If someone offers you a logo, make sure you check with them if they can create a brand identity for you.Marketing ideally should start before there is a product…or even a companyIf you are waiting for a plateau in sales to start your marketing efforts, you are way too late.Yes, I understand, you run a small business. Sure, there are more urgent expenses. But you don’t need a million-dollar marketing campaign.What you need is to know your customers and your product. Your effort should be to enhance the product so you always delight the customer. The rest will follow.Ideally, you should hire a marketing agency from the outset. Or find a freelancer who knows their craft. So you don’t build inconsistent messages. Or even worse, start offering unsellable products.Marketers are not magicians, and not everything can be fixed. If this is the case, they may even suggest rebranding.Subscribe. You will receive an email with a friend link.Every interaction with your customer is marketingEvery customer’s touch point with your product or service, I call marketing. It can be advertising or badvertising.What I mean is that you can’t press undo. In real life and in business, this button doesn’t exist.Everything you or your employees do or don’t do …Everything your product or service is or isn’t …… is building an image of your brand in front of your customers.An employee driving a company-branded car irresponsibly — badvertisingYou not answering an email on time, or not giving a clear feedback on when an answer is to be expected — badvertisingYou arguing with customers on Google reviews — badvertisingMe writing this article with the logo of my company as the header image — hopefully advertisingThe list can go on and on. I can probably try to expand it in a separate article one day. We will see how my writing career goes.After-sales marketing is equally as essential as pre-salesI see many business owners fixating on sales. They get their sales, and then what?Are these customers going to come back? For a repeat purchase I mean, not back to complain or ask for a refund.I am sure you have heard of this. Over and over. To win a new customer costs 5–6 times more than to keep an established one. Blah blah. We all know it. And yet, why do so few companies do something about it?You can always show customers that you care about them and their experience.Even if you don’t have the budget. Just be polite by checking on them after the sale. See if everything is fine. Don’t wait for negative reviews. If you follow that advice, you may even resolve issues that no one expected you to resolve. Read: Loyalty boost.And if you are a big company with deep pockets, you have no excuse. You need to invest in retention marketing.The bigger the purchase, the more invested your customers are. Therefore they will need more reassurance that the choice was right. You need to be there and assure them your product/service was indeed the best fit. Not nice to have, but a must-have.Instead of conclusionI tried to summarize the article in a single picture.As a business owner, you don’t have to be a marketing expert. If you can’t afford to work with a marketing agency from the get-go, it is also understandable. Just make sure every action you take to promote your business has the customer in mind.Make it a habit to ask yourself:How would this affect my customer? And How would this affect my image?That is how we think at Vizzuell. If it resonates with you, let’s talk business and marketing strategy.

You Need to Know These Frameworks & Techniques as a Product Manager | by Jayendra More | BootcampOpen in appSign upSign inWriteSign upSign inMastodonYou Need to Know These Frameworks & Techniques as a Product ManagerJayendra More·FollowPublished inBootcamp·11 min read·Aug 9, 2023--9ListenShareAs a Product Manager, you’re well aware of the array of frameworks available to support different aspects of product management and development. From PRDs to understanding your target audience, customer insights, marketing strategies, and beyond — these frameworks are essential. In this blog, we’ll dive into some essential and useful frameworks tailored for Product Managers. And remember, knowledge never goes to waste, so even if you’re not a PM, there’s always something to learn.As a Product Manager, you are well aware of the various stages of a product’s development. In each of these stages, frameworks are available for you to use. These frameworks serve as valuable tools to help you gain a deeper understanding of your product and improve its metrics.Lets now learn about a few important frameworks,1. StorytellingAs a Product Manager, you are aware of the concept of storytelling. Every PM needs to learn this art of storytelling — yes, you heard it right, I won’t call storytelling a framework, but an art. As a product manager, you must be able to articulate your thoughts in a simple and easy-to-understand manner, ensuring that your audience comprehends the entire topic and grasps the significance of your ideas.Storytelling plays a vital role in writing effective PRDs where you explain how features or products will work to your developers and team members. Thus, mastering this art is essential for every PM. Every story you tell or write serves as your requirement document. Each storytelling journey has a beginning, body, and end (result).A storytelling Product Manager is someone who excels in using storytelling techniques to communicate and present product ideas, strategies, and concepts. They go beyond merely sharing information; they craft compelling stories that emotionally engage stakeholders, customers, and team members.2. CIRCLESThe CIRCLES framework assists you with problem-solving and decision-making. As a product manager, it guides you on how to approach any situation. Every word in CIRCLES stands for a term. The CIRCLES framework covers vital aspects for product managers in product development. It guarantees to address customer needs, manage risks, promote collaboration, and make data-driven decisions through experimentation and success measurement.Let’s dive deep into each of these terms.Comprehend the SituationUnderstand the environment that gives rise to the need for the product. A product manager must comprehend the environment that drives a product’s requirements. Conducting thorough research and analysis is an essential task for a product manager. This aspect of the framework addresses the question of What? Who? Why? and How? regarding the requirements.Identify the CustomerOnce you have a complete understanding of the complete requirements, your next task is to begin considering the users who will utilize the feature. Building upon the accumulated requirements, we need to develop a persona for the average customer.Report the Need of the CustomerAfter comprehending the situation and developing user personas, the next step involves understanding the motivations behind why the customer would use our product. During this phase, it is essential to compile a list of the reasons that might drive the customer’s need for the product.User story → As [a user persona], I want [to perform this action] so that [I can accomplish this goal].Cut Through PrioritizationProvide an evaluation of your product’s position with respect to the market, followed by an estimated return on investment (ROI) analysis.List SolutionsList the potential solution to the problems for the identified user personas.Evaluate the TradeoffsEvery product will involve trade-offs. Understand your priorities and design the product accordingly.SummarizeProvide a summary of your design that includes all of the points. Here you mention everything about the requirement, what is the requirement, the complete recap, and why your product will stand out versus others.3. AARRRAARRR funnel, also known as the Pirate metric or funnel due to the way it sounds, is a simple framework used to identify customer behaviour. It’s an agile framework. AARRR commonly denotes a user flow on the application and each word here stands for a term,AcquisitionPlan to acquire new customers. In simple terms, it means how many people do you reach? how did they become aware of your product?ActivationHow many people visit your website, the customers you acquire, and what is their initial experience? how many of them have registered? how many of them use your product?RetentionOf the users who are registered on your platform or use your services, how many of them return back? In simple terms of the activated users, how many of them continue to use your product?RevenueHow many of those activated/registered users actually pay you?ReferralDo users who use your product like your services enough to refer to it?By monitoring the five pirate metrics, you can gain a complete view of user actions, identifying strengths and areas for improvement. The most difficult to improve in this framework are Revenue and Referral.4. HEARTHEART framework, initially developed at Google hence also called as Google framework. The HEART framework is a method used to measure the user experience and analyze the quality of products or services. The acronym HEART stands for Happiness, Engagement, Adoption, Retention, and Task success.We use HEART as the form of a table in order to judge the performance according to the metric. Rows are the steps and columns are the parameters.StepsHappinessThis measures the attitude of the user. That can be user satisfaction, and overall enjoyment when using the product or service.EngagementHow many users use your product? how actively users are interacting with the product?AdoptionThis measures the number of new users that you gain. Adoption evaluates how well users are incorporating the product into their daily routine.RetentionRetention measures how many users keep using the product. In simple terms, among gained users, how many are coming back?Task successAmong the task assigned to the users, how many have been completed? This metric looks at how well users can get things done using the product.ParametersGoalsHigh-level goals that have been considered to make your productSignalsUser signals that indicate the +ve or -ve trajectory of the product, rating your product 5 stars, spending more time on your product, staying active, etc.MetricsOfficial quantitive metrics that you monitor to determine success. These can be any metrics, for example, NPS, Avg. session length, feature adoption rate, churn rate, and crash rate.5. 4 Quadrant of time managementThe 4 Quadrants of Time Management categorize tasks into four groups based on their urgency and importance. Every task that you pick as a product manager has a deadline and priority(importance) assigned to it. This is a simple metric as mentioned in the image the x-axis determines the deadline(urgency) and the y-axis determines the priority(importance).Urgent and ImportantTasks in this quadrant need urgent attention and are critical. They often involve important issues.Not Urgent but ImportantTasks in this quadrant are important but not time-sensitive. These include activities like planning and strategizing.Urgent but Not ImportantTasks in this quadrant are usually distractions that demand urgent attention but don’t contribute significantly to your long-term goals.Not Urgent and Not ImportantThese are activities that provide little or no benefit and should be avoided or eliminated.The 4 Quadrants of Time Management help everyone prioritize tasks by focusing on what’s important and minimizing time on non-goal-oriented activities.6. 5 WhyThe “5 Whys” is a simple method in product management to find the main cause of a problem. You ask “why” multiple times, commonly five, to investigate deeply and find the actual reasons for the problem. This helps managers to understand problems and fix the actual root causes instead of just the surface symptoms. Repeatedly asking “why” helps reveal what’s actually going on, leading to better decisions making for improving the product.7. PrioritizationIn product management, prioritization means deciding what tasks and features come first. It ensures resources go to the most important areas, making the product successful and efficient.8. 4Ps of MarketingThe 4Ps of marketing, are also known as the marketing mix. The 4Ps of marketing provide a framework outlining the important elements for a company to consider when developing its marketing strategy. These elements are used to design a successful marketing campaign and promote the product. It also allows you to conduct analysis for product design and all the steps until it releases. The 4Ps stand for:ProductComplete summary of all features of the product from its need and its design to its branding. In simple terms ‘What are you selling?’PriceHow much it costs? Price lists, discounts, and depreciation over time may and should be considered. This element helps with the amount of money customers are willing to pay for the product.PlaceWhere can the customer get it? Supply chain, where to store, how to transport, market to be sold. Also known as distribution, this refers to the channels and methods through which the product or service reaches the customer.PromotionHow do you tell people about it? Public relations, online promotions, offline campaigns. This refers to the different tactics and strategies used to communicate and promote the product to the target audience.9. 5Cs of PricingThe 5 Cs of pricing is a framework that helps businesses decide their pricing strategies based on multiple factors. All these factors start with the letter “C,” making it easier to remember. The 5 Cs are:CostHow much your product costs you? This includes the production and operational costs involved in creating the product.CompatibilityYour pricing strategy should always match the company’s sales goals and overall objectives.CustomerThe value of the product’s delivery must align with its price. Understand how customers observe the value of your product or service.CompetitorsHow much do other similar products in the market cost? Analyze how the pricing you offer compares to similar offerings from competitors in your domain.ChannelHow much does the transportation and distribution channel inflate your costs? Evaluate the distribution channels you use and how they might impact pricing.10. REANIt’s a framework mainly used in digital marketing to help through the stages of a customer’s journey from initial awareness to becoming a loyal customer of your product. Here’s a breakdown of each stage:ReachReach the highest number of people you can. In this stage, you ideally aim to target your audience and make them aware of your brand.EngageOnce you’ve gained the audience’s attention, the next step is to engage them. You can engage with them through campaigns, competitions, videos, etc.ActivateActivate your consumer base and have them communicate with you. At this stage, your goal is to convert engaged prospects into customers.NurtureNurture the customer you have gained through regular communication11. AIDAORThe AIDAOR framework is a model for marketing that shows how customers react to marketing messages. This model helps market your product to the highest number of people possible. Each letter represents a stage of the process:AwarenessThe first step is to create awareness for your brand and what it stands for.InterestThrough your marketing strategy generate interest in your product and highlight its benefits to your customers.DesireOnce you determine their interest in your product, create a desire for your product by building an emotional connection with your target audience.ActionCTA, tell your prospective customer what they should do if they want to procure your product.RetentionOffer your customer a great experience so that they return to your product.12. RFMRFM stands for “Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value.” RFM is a method used in marketing to group and target customers based on how often they buy.RecencyThis refers to how recently a customer purchase was made.FrequencyThis measures how often a customer makes purchases within a specific time.MarginThis represents the amount of money a customer has spent on purchases.By looking at these three things, responsible teams can classify customers into groups like high-value, medium-value, or low-value. If all of the above are large enough, that translates to the ideal profitable customer.13. 5 ForcesIt helps you figure out how tough the competition will be for your product in the market. Also known as Porter’s Five Forces.The Threat of New EntryWill the entry of a new, similar product impact your position in the market? How easily new companies can enter the market?The Threat of SubstitutionHow easily can the consumer find an alternate product that does what your product does?Supply PowerTo what extent does your supplier determine the cost and availability of your product?Buyer PowerHow easy is it for your buyers to bring about a change in the price of your product?Competitive rivalryHow robust and well-established are competitors’ products?By studying these forces, businesses can decide how to compete better and where they fit in the current industry.14. DIGSDIGS is similar to the storytelling framework. Each letter represents a stage of the process:Determine the issue.Indicate and outline the alternatives.Go through the solutions you have came up with.Summarize the product you will offer.15. 5EsThis model helps you with simulating the experience of the user while using your product. Each letter represents a stage of the process:Entice Understand the requirements of the customer, and analyze why the customer is coming to your product.Enter How does the customer reach your product?Engage How easy is it to use your product?Exit How easy to complete a task for the user? what issues did he face?Extend Once the task is completed how do you follow up with the customer?16. RICEThe RICE framework is a method used for prioritizing tasks. Each letter stands for a criterion:Reach How many people will be affected by the task?Impact What is the potential positive outcome of the task?Confidence How confident are you about the projected outcomes?Effort How much time, resources, and work will be required to complete the task?By assigning scores or values to each criterion we determine how important the task will be. (R x I x C)/ E ⇒ higher the number imp the task.17.

Top 10 Strategies That Will Transform Marketing In 2024. | by The Marketing Hustle | Feb, 2024 | MediumOpen in appSign upSign inWriteSign upSign inTop 10 Strategies That Will Transform Marketing In 2024.The Marketing Hustle·Follow6 min read·Feb 26, 2024--3ListenShareAs we drift slowly into 2024, the marketing landscape is poised for another leap forward, driven by rapid technological advancements and changing consumer behaviors.This year demands a blend of innovation, agility, and a deep understanding of digital ecosystems to craft strategies that not only resonate with audiences but also set the pace for competitors to follow.In my experience, innovation in marketing isn’t just about adopting the latest technologies or jumping on new platforms; it’s about rethinking how we connect with our audience, understanding their evolving needs, and creating experiences that matter to them.It’s about building relationships, trust, and value in every interaction. As someone who has navigated the ebbs and flows of marketing trends, I’ve seen firsthand the impact of strategic innovation.The strategies that will transform marketing this year aren’t just trends; they’re a reflection of a deeper shift towards more personalized, immersive, and ethical marketing practices.The road ahead is exciting and challenging, with opportunities to redefine what it means to engage with consumers.As we delve into the top 10 innovative strategies for 2024, we’ll explore not just the ‘what’ but the ‘why’ and the ‘how’ of these shifts, drawing on professional insights and personal experiences to paint a comprehensive picture of the future of marketing.Whether you’re a seasoned marketer or a business owner looking to stay ahead of the curve, understanding these strategies will be crucial to navigating the dynamic landscape of 2024 successfully.Table of Contents1.

Privacy-First Personalization7. Influencer Collaborations and Co-Creation8. Cross-Channel Marketing Integration9. Real-Time and Predictive Analytics10. Blockchain Technology in MarketingConclusion: Embracing the Future of Marketing1. Personalization at ScaleIn the world of marketing, personalization has transitioned from a nice-to-have to a critical differentiator. As we look towards 2024, the concept of personalization is set to undergo a transformative shift, moving beyond basic customizations to offer truly individualized customer experiences at scale. This evolution is powered by advancements in AI and data analytics, allowing marketers to understand and predict customer preferences with unprecedented accuracy.The essence of personalization at scale lies in its ability to make each customer feel uniquely understood and valued. Imagine a world where marketing messages, product recommendations, and even the timing of engagements are so tailored to an individual that every interaction feels personal. This is not just about improving sales; it’s about building a deeper, more meaningful relationship with each customer.From my professional experience, the implementation of personalization at scale has shown to significantly enhance customer loyalty and engagement. Companies that excel in personalization can see a notable increase in customer lifetime value, as personalized experiences often lead to repeated engagements and increased trust. The key lies in leveraging data not just to sell, but to serve, providing value that resonates with each customer’s specific needs and preferences.However, achieving this level of personalization requires a sophisticated understanding of data and a commitment to using it responsibly. Privacy considerations are paramount, as consumers become increasingly aware of and concerned about how their data is used. Balancing personalization with privacy is a delicate dance that marketers must master to earn and maintain consumer trust.In 2024, personalization at scale will not be just a strategy but a necessity, driving marketers to innovate and adopt new technologies that enable them to connect with their audience on a deeper level. The future of marketing lies in creating personalized experiences that not only meet but anticipate customer needs, making every interaction meaningful and every customer feel valued.2. Voice and Visual Search OptimizationAs we navigate through the digital age, voice and visual search are rapidly gaining traction, reshaping how consumers find information, products, and services online. The rise of smart speakers, voice assistants, and advanced image recognition technologies has made voice and visual searches not just convenient but often the preferred method of interaction for many users.By the end of 2024, optimizing for these search modalities will be imperative for brands looking to maintain visibility and relevance in a crowded digital landscape.From a personal perspective, adapting to voice and visual search has been an enlightening journey. It’s fascinating to see how natural language processing and AI have evolved to understand not just what we say, but how we say it, capturing the nuances of human speech and visual cues.This shift necessitates a more conversational and visually appealing approach to content creation. It’s not just about keywords anymore; it’s about context, relevance, and engaging the user in a more intuitive way.Professionally, integrating voice and visual search optimization into marketing strategies has proven to be both a challenge and an opportunity. The challenge lies in understanding the different ways people use voice and visual searches compared to traditional text-based queries.The opportunity, however, is immense. By optimizing for these searches, brands can connect with their audience at a more instinctive level, providing answers and solutions in the way users now seek them.Voice search optimization often involves focusing on long-tail keywords and question-based queries, mirroring natural speech patterns. For visual search, it’s about ensuring images are high-quality, contextually relevant, and properly tagged to appear in visual search results. Both require a deep understanding of your audience’s search behavior and preferences.As we slide into 2024, the brands that will thrive are those that recognize the importance of voice and visual search optimization. It’s a testament to the ever-evolving nature of technology and user behavior, urging marketers to continuously adapt and innovate.Embracing these changes not only enhances search visibility but also fosters a deeper connection with the audience by meeting them where they are and in the manner they prefer.3. Interactive and Immersive ContentIn the ever-evolving digital landscape, the emergence of interactive and immersive content has marked a significant shift in how brands engage with their audiences.This transformative approach to content creation, leveraging technologies such as virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and interactive video, offers users not just information but experiences.As we look towards 2024, these immersive experiences are set to redefine the boundaries of digital engagement, offering new dimensions of interaction that are more engaging, memorable, and impactful.Drawing from my journey in the digital marketing realm, it’s clear that interactive and immersive content is not a fleeting trend but a fundamental shift in consumer expectations.Users today seek more than passive consumption; they desire to be part of the story, to influence its outcome, and to immerse themselves in experiences that resonate on a personal level.This shift represents a unique opportunity for brands to connect with their audience in a more meaningful way, creating experiences that leave lasting impressions and foster deep emotional connections.From a professional perspective, incorporating immersive technologies into marketing strategies requires a blend of creativity, technical understanding, and a keen sense of storytelling.The power of VR and AR, for example, lies in their ability to transport users to different places, times, or situations, enabling brands to showcase their products or services in context, simulate real-life experiences, or create entirely new worlds for users to explore.Interactive videos, on the other hand, empower users to control their journey, making decisions that tailor the narrative to their preferences.The challenge, however, lies in crafting these experiences in a way that is accessible, engaging, and relevant to the target audience. It’s not just about the novelty of the technology but how it is used to convey a message, tell a story, or solve a problem.As we advance, the brands that succeed will be those that not only embrace these technologies but also integrate them seamlessly into their overall marketing strategy, ensuring they add real value to the user experience.In 2024, interactive and immersive content will be more than just an option; it will be a critical component of effective digital marketing strategies. By embracing these technologies, brands can create more profound, engaging, and memorable experiences that not only captivate their audience but also drive deeper engagement, loyalty, and advocacy…>>> Keep Reading Over At TMHMarketingMarketing StrategiesBusinessAIBrand Strategy----3FollowWritten by The Marketing Hustle850 FollowersFounder/Creative Director.

Understanding Marketing Mix Modeling with Meta’s Robyn | by Rochan Nehete | MediumOpen in appSign upSign inWriteSign upSign inUnderstanding Marketing Mix Modeling with Meta’s RobynRochan Nehete·Follow13 min read·Jun 5, 2023--2ListenShareLast night I was watching the movie ‘Air’ with my friend and was blown away by the amount of risk shown to be taken in the film.It got me thinking, if I had the next Michael Jordan ready to support me on a small-scale brand, how would I go about with the marketing budget in the first place? I suddenly got a flashback of a method I encountered during my previous experience, Marketing Mix Modeling. In this article, I seek to explore an open-source library for MMM called Robyn, developed by Meta. But before that,What is Marketing Mix Modeling(MMM)?Marketing mix modeling (MMM) is a statistical analysis technique used to measure and evaluate the impact of various marketing variables on sales and other key performance indicators. It involves analyzing historical data to quantify the effects of marketing activities such as advertising, promotions, pricing, and distribution channels, and determining their individual and combined contributions to business outcomes. MMM helps businesses optimize their marketing strategies by identifying the most effective allocation of resources and understanding the ROI of different marketing investments. It's like putting all your marketing ingredients into a big pot and seeing what delicious dish comes out!So your brand has decided to perform MMM and has a budget to do so, but how would they do it? There are 3 widely accepted methods you can go about it, ordered by decreasing the amount of investment required and increasing the number of resources required:3rd Party Vendors($$$): There are 3rd party vendors that specialize in MMM such as Nielsen. They drive the entire engagement providing a high level of consultancyMMM SaaS products ($$) : There are products in the market such as Analytics Edge that can provide MMM solutionsOpen source solutions ($): It is possible for brands to drive their MMM efforts using an open source library such as Robyn, an open source R project developed by Meta’s Marketing Science division with comprehensive documentation.Each of these has its own pros and cons. Whatever you choose, there are a the following common steps involved:Data Collection: Gathering relevant data on marketing activities and sales to understand the impact of different elements in the marketing mix.Data Analysis: Analyzing the collected data to identify patterns, correlations, and trends that reveal the effectiveness of marketing efforts.Variable Selection: Selecting the key variables or factors that significantly influence sales and marketing performance.Model Building: Developing a statistical model that quantifies the relationship between marketing variables and sales outcomes.Model Validation: Testing and validating the accuracy and reliability of the model to ensure its effectiveness in predicting future outcomes.Scenario Simulation: Running simulations and “what-if” scenarios to assess the potential impact of changes in marketing strategies and variables.For my purpose, I used the simulated dataset from Robyn.Robyn uses Facebook’s Prophet to perform time series decomposition, ridge regression in order to regularize multi-collinearity and prevent overfitting, and Facebook’s hyperparameter optimization library Nevergrad.Data Exploration and Feature EngineeringFollowing is what our dataset looks like:Robyn’s dt_simulated_weekly datasetWe would input this dataset to Robyn using robyn_inputs() methodFor MMM, generally weekly data is used as daily data can tend to be noisy. A common recommendation is having at least 2–3 years of historical data, including detailed information on marketing activities, sales or revenue data, and other relevant variables such as pricing, promotions, and external factors (e.g., economic indicators). The more data available, the better the model can capture seasonality, trends, and other patterns. Robyn also supports Prophet’s holiday data and we simply need to specify the country code(eg. US, DE) to make use of it.Our dependent variable would be revenue, but if the business demands, we can choose to have conversions as well. There can only be one dependent variable.Paid Media Variables: Any media variables with a clear marketing spend falls into this category. This includes TV, Out of house advertising(eg. billboards), Facebook (facebook_I = impressions, facebook_S = spend), and search clicks. For exposure level metrics, we can use impressions, clicks or GRP(Gross Rating Point = Reach % * Avg. frequency of impressions).While defining channels, it is optimum to split channels into sub-channels for better performance. For example, Facebook ad campaign in the real world can be split into fb_prospecting (to acquire people not familiar with your product) and fb_retargeting(for existing customers)Context Variables: These include other variables that are not paid or organic media that can help explain the dependent variable. We can specify context variables(context_vars) to Robyn such as competitor sales, price and promotional events, temperature, unemployment rate, CPI or COVID. This is one of the focus points during the data collection phase.Organic Variables: Any marketing activities without a clear marketing spend fall into this category. This would include social media posts, push notifications, and newsletter sendings with the organic_vars variable. For all types of variables within Robyn, there is support to define the relationship of the variable as default, positive and negative. We can also force context or organic variables to be categorical using the factor_vars variable.Defining a window: A window definition gives us the option to select a modeling window that would best describe our business. This is especially helpful as businesses keep changing over time. For example, an ad channel such as Instagram may have been profitable previously but it is not saturated due to competition.AdstockAdstock is a concept used in marketing and advertising analytics to capture the lingering effect or carryover impact of past advertising exposures on consumer behavior, specifically diminishing returns (decreasing marginal returns after a certain saturation point in spending). In Robyn, we can choose between 3 types of adstocks:1. Geometric — Fixed decay rate over time, which only requires 1 parameter. This will run the model faster than the others.2. Weibull CDF — Flexible decay rate with 2 parameters to control the S-shape of the decay and inflection point of the decay curve.3. Weibull PDF — Flexible decay rate with the same 2 parameters, the only difference is that PDF offers a lagged effect.I chose geometric for my model. Depending upon the choice of adstock chosen, we can specify ranges for hyperparameters of our model.SaturationRobyn utilizes the Hill function to reflect the saturation of each media channel. A Hill function is a two-parametric function in Robyn with alpha and gamma:Alpha controls the shape of the curve between exponential and s-shape. We recommend a bound of c(0.5, 3) — note that the larger the alpha, the more S-shape and the smaller the alpha, the more C-shape.Gamma controls the inflexion point. We recommend a bound of c(0.3, 1) — note that the larger the gamma, the later the inflection point in the response curve.Prophet Seasonality DecompositionProphet is a Meta open source code for forecasting time series data. Prophet has automatically been included in the Robyn code to decompose the data into trend, seasonality, holiday, and weekday impacts, in order to improve the model fit and ability to forecast. Following is how the time series decomposition from Prophet within Robyn looks like:Time series Decomposition for ProphetOverall this is how our InputCollect variable for robyn_inputs would look like:InputCollect <- robyn_inputs( dt_input = dt_simulated_weekly, dt_holidays = dt_prophet_holidays, date_var = "DATE", # date format must be "2020-01-01" dep_var = "revenue", # there should be only one dependent variable dep_var_type = "revenue", # "revenue" (ROI) or "conversion" (CPA) prophet_vars = c("trend", "season", "holiday"), # "trend","season", "weekday" & "holiday" prophet_country = "DE", # input one country. dt_prophet_holidays includes 59 countries by default context_vars = c("competitor_sales_B", "events"), # e.g. competitors, discount, unemployment etc paid_media_spends = c("tv_S", "ooh_S", "print_S", "facebook_S", "search_S"), # mandatory input paid_media_vars = c("tv_S", "ooh_S", "print_S", "facebook_I", "search_clicks_P"), # mandatory. organic_vars = "newsletter", # marketing activity without media spend factor_vars = c("events"), # force variables in context_vars or organic_vars to be categorical window_start = "2016-01-01", window_end = "2018-12-31", adstock = "geometric" # geometric, weibull_cdf or weibull_pdf.)Modeling Techniques ​MMM uses regression, which aims to derive an equation that describes the dependent variable with high explainability. Although, this can also be replaced by other modeling techniques having lesser explainability(which can be overcome by using SHAP) covered in this article.While using regression, overfitting, and multicollinearity are commonly addressed issues in regression analysis. We can use VIF to detect multicollinearity during our EDAVIF is seen to be below 5 for independent variables, hence no multicollinearityBut we can address these issues together using regularization techniques. Robyn uses ridge regression, which shrinks coefficients toward zero if those variables have a minor contribution to the dependent variable.Model SelectionRobyn uses Nevergrad, an optimization library developed by Facebook for hyperparameter tuning. While selecting the optimal model, it looks at 2 main evaluation criteria over iterations which can be obtained by the pareto-front chart:NRMSE: Normalized Root mean squared error tells us how many times a model went wrong. Root mean square error can be used to compare different models. However, RMSE doesn’t perform well if comparing models fits for different response variables or if the response variable is standardized, log-transformed, or otherwise modified. To overcome these issues, the NRMSE is used instead.DECOMP.RSSD: The Decomposition Root Sum of Squared Distance is also referred to as the business error. It tells us whether the model is going unrealistic. For eg. If I put 80% of my budget in TikTok and Robyn would assign the impact of TikTok as 0%, it doesn’t make sense. This is the model going unrealisticPareto Front graph for model Selection by NevergradOutputModels <- robyn_run( InputCollect = InputCollect, # feed in all model specification cores = NULL, # NULL defaults to (max available - 1) iterations = 2000, # 2000 recommended for the dummy dataset with no calibration trials = 5, # 5 recommended for the dummy dataset ts_validation = TRUE, # 3-way-split time series for NRMSE validation. add_penalty_factor = FALSE # Experimental feature. Use with caution.)print(OutputModels)Model CalibrationCalibration tells us how confident a model is with its predictions. It is a highly recommended step in Marketing Mix Modeling given a prior incrementality test has been performed before releasing the marketing budget.It is possible to obtain ground truth to calibrate our model by testing out advertising operations on a subset consisting of 2 groups: Control and Test. The control group is not exposed to any ads and revenue/conversions obtained from them would be a natural baseline, whereas the Test group would be subjected to advertisements and the corresponding revenue/conversions would be obtained. Using these two outputs, we can calculate the corresponding lift metrics. The control and test groups can be divided as people-based, geographically, or on the basis of different devices. The longer the test study, the more the long tail effect can be captured.Robyn can take in the calibration data as input before its modeling, which enables Nevergrad to use MAPE(Mean absolute percentage error) in addition to the two evaluation metrics.calibration_input <- data.frame( # channel name must in paid_media_vars channel = c("facebook_S", "tv_S", "facebook_S+search_S", "newsletter"), # liftStartDate must be within input data range liftStartDate = as.Date(c("2018-05-01", "2018-04-03", "2018-07-01", "2017-12-01")), # liftEndDate must be within input data range liftEndDate = as.Date(c("2018-06-10", "2018-06-03", "2018-07-20", "2017-12-31")), # Provided value must be tested on same campaign level in model and same metric as dep_var_type liftAbs = c(400000, 300000, 700000, 200), # Spend within experiment: should match within a 10% error your spend on date range for each channel from dt_input spend = c(421000, 7100, 350000, 0), # Confidence: if frequentist experiment, you may use 1 - pvalue confidence = c(0.85, 0.8, 0.99, 0.95), # KPI measured: must match your dep_var metric = c("revenue", "revenue", "revenue", "revenue"), # Either "immediate" or "total". For experimental inputs like Facebook Lift, "immediate" is recommended. calibration_scope = c("immediate", "immediate", "immediate", "immediate"))InputCollect <- robyn_inputs(InputCollect = InputCollect, calibration_input = calibration_input)Interpreting Modeling ResultsOur modeling approach gives us the best models obtained from the lower left part of our pareto-front chart. We can analyze the performance of each model along effects of variables and combined contribution towards business outcomes. Robyn gives us different visualizations for each model with a one-pager for a model to compare.OutputCollect <- robyn_outputs( InputCollect, OutputModels, pareto_fronts = "auto", # automatically pick how many pareto-fronts to fill min_candidates (100) # min_candidates = 100, # top pareto models for clustering. Default to 100 # calibration_constraint = 0.1, # range c(0.01, 0.1) & default at 0.1 csv_out = "pareto", # "pareto", "all", or NULL (for none) clusters = TRUE, # Set to TRUE to cluster similar models by ROAS. See ?robyn_clusters export = create_files, # this will create files locally plot_folder = robyn_directory, # path for plots exports and files creation plot_pareto = create_files # Set to FALSE to deactivate plotting and saving model one-pagers)print(OutputCollect)One Pager report for each model outputted by robyn_onepagersmyOnePager <- robyn_onepagers(InputCollect, OutputCollect, select_model, export = FALSE)On the top, you can see the R-squared(R2) value along with NRMSE, DECOMP: RSSD, and MAPE. The R-squared value tells us how much of the variance of the dependent variable is explained by the independent variables in regression, typically referred to as the goodness of fit of the model to the observed data.The waterfall chart tells us how much % of the revenue is attributed to each channel. So for example, the competitor's sales attributed to 49.3% of revenue, which means as the competitor is selling more, it is triggering conversions or revenue on our brand as well. This can indicate that your target audience is actively comparing and evaluating options from different competitors before making a purchasing decision.The actual vs predicted response shows how good was our model when it came to predicting revenue over time.The Total Spend% vs Effect% horizontal bar graph shows us how much we ended up spending on the channel and what was the effectivity of each channelThe response curves and mean spends by channel, sometimes called saturation curves, indicate if a specific media channel’s spend is at an optimal level or if it is approaching saturation and therefore suggest potential budget reallocation.The adstock decay chart represents, on average, the percentage decay rate each channel had. The higher the decay rate, the more time it would take for a specific media channel to have an effect after the initial exposure.The fitted vs residual chart helps us to identify outlier points. These can help us identify any variables we may have left out in our analysis(for example COVID)After considering different tradeoffs and reconsidering variables we might have left off, we select a model which meets our business needs on the basis of our analysis, for budget allocation.Budget AllocationThe most crucial part of decision-making involves considering what-if situations for a budget. In this section, we take a look at how we can answer different questions which can be asked about our modeling results by decision-makers.For every selected model result, the robyn_allocator() function can be applied to get the optimal budget mix that maximizes the response(revenue or conversions). Now for the fun partScenario 1: What is the maximum return I can obtain given a certain spend?To answer this, we use the Robyn allocator as followsAllocatorCollect <- robyn_allocator( InputCollect = InputCollect, OutputCollect = OutputCollect, select_model = select_model, # Our selected model # date_range = "last_10", used to specify across what period the question is asked. Last 10 periods, same as c("2018-10-22", "2018-12-31"). Default = latest month total_budget = 5000000, # Total budget for date_range period simulation channel_constr_low = c(0.8, 0.7, 0.7, 0.7, 0.7), # Minimum spend on a channel channel_constr_up = c(1.2, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5), # Maximum spend on a channel channel_constr_multiplier = 3, # Customise bound extension for wider insights scenario = "max_response", # Need to maximize the response variable, revenue in our case export = create_files)Budget allocation for max ROI, fixed budget (Refer blue charts)We can see that by keeping the total spending the same, we can increase the ROAS by 22.7% by reallocating our budget per channel as per the blue table. The response curve shows us how the response would look like over the amount of spend we give, and shows us our initial points and proposed points.Scenario 2: How much do I have to spend to hit a target ROAS/CPA of x?To answer this, we use the make a small change in the scenario parameter of Robyn allocator and add the target as follows:AllocatorCollect <- robyn_allocator( InputCollect = InputCollect, OutputCollect = OutputCollect, select_model = select_model, # date_range = NULL, # Default last month as initial period scenario = "target_efficiency", target_value = 2, # Customize target ROAS or CPA value according to business needs export = create_files)Budget allocations for target ROAS of 2 (Refer blue charts)We observe that in order to achieve a return on ad spend of 2, we need to decrease spending by 24.6%, reallocate the budget per channel as shown in the blue table and settle for a reduced revenue by 19.1%.You can also obtain the marginal responses for each additional $ spent on a channel by using robyn_response with metric value = Spend + $All codes to reproduce content within this article, along with charts and visualization reports, can be found on my GitHub repository here.References:[1] Robyn’s Webpage: https://facebookexperimental.github.io/Robyn/[2] Robyn CRAN documentation: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Robyn/Robyn.pdfMarketingAnalyticsMarketing Mix ModelingTime Series ForecastingOptimization----2FollowWritten by Rochan Nehete18 FollowersMeet Rochan, a Business Analytics student eager to learn new things in data.

15 Blogging Mistakes I Made Before Hitting 50K Daily Visitors | MediumOpen in appSign upSign inWriteSign upSign in15 Blogging Mistakes I Made Before Hitting 50K Daily Visitors on my WebsiteAyush Tanwal·Follow5 min read·Jan 29, 2024--49ListenShareEver wondered why some blogs skyrocket to success while others plateau?I’ve been on both sides of that coin. Through trial and error, I discovered the “don’ts” that are crucial for a website’s success.But it wasn’t easy. I made mistakes — lots of them.Fast forward to today, I can create websites that ranks on top of search results in just a few weeks.🚀 In fact, I catapulted my recent blog from obscurity to 50,000 daily visitors in 30 days.Today, I’m pulling back the curtain to reveal the 15 critical blunders I made and how you can dodge these blogging landmines.Let’s get started.1. Ignoring Audience ResearchI had decent writing skills when I started blogging, and through some online videos, I learnt that I should target keywords that have less competition.Thus I started writing around those less competitive keywords without any second thoughts.Big mistake 🙅🏻‍♂️It was like shooting in the dark, creating content without a clear understanding of my audience.It wasn’t until I started researching my audience’s interests and needs that I began to see engagement and traffic spike. Remember, your content needs to resonate with your readers even when using less competitive keywords.2. Overlooking SEO BasicsSEO seemed complex, so I ignored it. But only when I got the hang of basic SEO practices like keyword research and on-page optimisation, my organic traffic soared.It’s true that your content solely have the power to make your blog a hit, but you can’t expect that to happen if people don’t even find it in the first place.SEO is not optional; it’s fundamental.3. Underestimating the Power of HeadlinesYour headline is the first, and possibly only, impression you make on a prospective reader.I learned that compelling, curiosity inducing headlines increased my click-through rates dramatically.Moreover, out of the 21 actionable things you can do to improve your CTR, 9 are directly related to having an optimised title. Check out yourself.4. Not Optimising for Mobile UsersI underestimated the mobile audience. Once I optimised my blog for mobile, I saw a significant uptick in traffic.Mobile optimisation is no longer optional; it’s essential.Make sure your website is well optimised for mobile users or you can simple pick themes that perform great even on mobiles.You can ask me in comments 💬 if you are unsure which Wordpress theme you should use.5. Not Updating Old ContentWould you believe if I told you that I used to update each of my blog posts every 2–3 days?Well not ‘every’ blog post, but I made sure I updated my well performing blogs almost every third day!This not only boosted their SEO but also provided continuous value to my readers.From Google’s POV; old content can become outdated and irrelevant. So keep your content fresh and up-to-date.6. Failing to Optimise Site Speed and PerformanceSlow site speed equals lost visitors and drop in search rankings. This is not news for most of you I know, but still I bet most of my readers have overlooked their site’s speed and performance.I learned optimising my site’s performance was non-negotiable for retaining readers and improving search rankings. Fast loading times keep readers happy and engaged.✨ Instant Tip: You must have LightSpeed (or any other plugin) installed and properly set up with your website.7. Poor Content StructureUnorganised content is a reader’s nightmare. Clear, concise, and well-structured content keeps readers engaged. Breaking up text with headings, bullets, and images works wonders for readability.But do you know that search engines also love organised content?8. Not Using Analytics to Guide Content StrategyData is your friend. Once I started using analytics to understand what content worked, I could tailor my strategy to what my audience wanted more of.This insight is crucial for growth.Your Google search console dashboard is your greatest ally when creating content. It gives you the best keywords and content ideas that even tools like SEMrush and Ahrefs can’t.How?I will dissect into this step-by-step in my next story, make sure to subscribe to my email list. 🥳9. Overlooking User Experience and DesignA clunky website design can drive visitors away. Improving my site’s design and user experience led to longer visits and lower bounce rates.Your website should be as enjoyable as your content.10. Skipping the Use of Categories and TagsIn the beginning, my blog was a maze. Properly categorising and tagging posts simplified navigation, enhancing user experience and SEO. It’s like organising a library — it must be easy to navigate.You can also use breadcrumbs to make navigation even easier. Using breadcrumbs in your website can benefit user experience and SEO.Breadcrumbs are these small navigation handles on top of your website’s page (You can easily deploy these using free plugins)👇11. Limited Use of Visuals and MultimediaText only posts can be dull.Incorporating visuals and multimedia not only made my content more engaging but also more shareable. Diverse media formats can significantly enrich user experience.12. Inconsistent Posting ScheduleIn the early days, my posting schedule was all over the place. Consistency is key.When I started posting regularly, my audience knew when to expect new content, which significantly boosted engagement.13. Neglecting Email List BuildingLike most of the new bloggers, I didn’t prioritise building my email list from day one, a decision I later regretted.Your email list is a direct link to your audience, making it an invaluable asset for driving traffic and building relationships.✨ Instant Tip: You can install plugins to help you collect & build an email list easily.14. Avoiding Networking with Other BloggersBlogging is not a solo journey. Collaborating with fellow bloggers opened up opportunities for guest posts, backlinks, and shared audiences.Networking is a game-changer.15. Limited Experimentation with Different Writing StylesI played it safe with a singular writing style, which was a missed opportunity.Experimenting with various styles — from formal to conversational — can resonate with a wider audience and keep content fresh.☄️ Quick Question: What do you think about my writing style? Tell me in comments.Ending notes;Each of these mistakes was a learning opportunity that helped me grow my blog to 50K daily visitors.I hope you can leapfrog these common pitfalls and fast-track your way to blogging success.What’s next?In my upcoming story, I will share one of my keyword research strategies that exactly tells me if my website will rank for these keywords or not.I promise these upcoming weeks will be a long collection of insights that will truly help you achieve results with your website and your brand!🧧 If you want me to help you in SEO, leave me an email from my bio.Until then, keep experimenting, keep learning, and keep growing!Peace out, AyushSEOSeo TipsBloggingWebsite TrafficMarketing----49FollowWritten by Ayush Tanwal2K Followers🌟 I help blogs turn into businesses | Founder @ RankShark | Connect 📧 luckktanwal@gmail.com | Growth Marketer for India's largest Ed-Tech brandsFollowHelpStatusAboutCareersBlogPrivacyTermsText to speechTeams 
Customer Segmentation using K-Means Algorithm in Python | MediumOpen in appSign upSign inWriteSign upSign inStep by Step Customer Segmentation using K-Means in PythonUğur Savcı·Follow11 min read·Jan 28, 2022--5ListenShareSegment your customers for better marketing.Table of ContentsIntroduction — What is Customer Segmentation?Business ScenarioExplore the DatasetData PreprocessingK-Means for SegmentationPCA with K-Means for better visualizationConclusionIntroductionLet’s say, you decided to buy a t-shirt from a brand online. Have you ever thought that who else bought the same t-shirt?People, who have similar to you, right? Same age, same hobbies, same gender, etc.In marketing, Companies basically try to find your t-shirts on other people!But wait ? How? Of course, with data!Customer segmentation is that simple!We actually try to find and group customers based on common characteristics such as age, gender, living area, spending behavior, etc. So that we can market the customers effectively.Let’s dive into our segmentation project!Business ScenarioSuppose we are working as a data scientist for a FMCG company and want to segment our customers to help the marketing department for them to launch new products and sales based on the segmentation. Therefore we will save our time and money by marketing a specific group of customers with selected products.How Did we collect the data by the way?All data has been collected through the loyalty cards they use at checkout :)We will utilize K-Means and PCA algorithms for this project and see how we define new grouped customers!Understanding Data is Important!Before starting any project, We need to understand the business problem and dataset first.Let’s see the variables(features) in the dataset.Variable DescriptionID: Shows a unique identification of a customer.Sex: Biological sex (gender) of a customer. In this dataset, there are only 2 different options.0: male1: femaleMarital status: Marital status of a customer.0: single1: non-single (divorced / separated / married / widowed)Age: The age of the customer in years, calculated as current year minus the year of birth of the customer at the time of the creation of the dataset18 Min value (the lowest age observed in the dataset)76 Max value (the highest age observed in the dataset)Education: Level of education of the customer.0:other / unknown1: high school2: university3: graduate schoolIncome: Self-reported annual income in US dollars of the customer.35832 Min value (the lowest income observed in the dataset)309364 Max value (the highest income observed in the dataset)Occupation: Category of occupation of the customer.0: unemployed/unskilled1: skilled employee / official2: management / self-employed / highly qualified employee / officerSettlement size: The size of the city that the customer lives in.0: small city1: mid-sized city2: big cityWe have datasets and know the business problem. Now, Let’s start coding!Importing LibrariesIn this project, we will need some friends that help you along the way!Let me introduce them below,### Data Analysis and Manipulation import pandas as pd import numpy as np### Data Visualizationimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport seaborn as snssns.set() ## this is for styling### Data Standardization and Modeling with K-Means and PCAfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScalerfrom sklearn.cluster import KMeansfrom sklearn.decomposition import PCA3. Explore the Datasetdf= pd.read_csv('segmentation data.csv', index_col = 0)This part consists of understanding data with the help of descriptive analysis and visualization.df.head()df.head() outputWe can also apply the describe method to see descriptive statistics about the columns.df.describe()We see the mean of Age and Income 35.90 and 120954 respectively. Describe method is very useful for numerical columns.df.info()df.info() method returns information about the DataFrame including the index data type and columns, non-null values, and memory usage.We see that there is no missing value in the dataset and all the variables are integer.A good way to get an initial understanding of the relationship between the different variables is to explore how they correlate.We calculate the correlation between our variables using corr method in the pandas library.plt.figure(figsize=(12,9))sns.heatmap(df.corr(),annot=True,cmap='RdBu')plt.title('Correlation Heatmap',fontsize=14)plt.yticks(rotation =0)plt.show()Let’s explore the correlation.We see that there is a strong correlation between Education and Age. In other words, older people tend to be more highly educated.How about income and occupation?Their correlation is 0.68. That means If you have a higher salary, you are more likely to have a higher-level occupation such as a manager.Correlation matrix is a very useful tool to analyze the relationship between features.Now, we understand our dataset and have a general idea of it.Next section will be the segmentation. But before that, we need to scale our data first.4. Data PreprocessingWe need to apply standardization to our features before using any distance-based machine learning model such as K-Means, KNN.In general, We want to treat all the features equally and we can achieve that by transforming the features in such a way that their values fall within the same numerical range such as [0:1].This process is commonly referred to as Standardization.StandardizationNow that we cleared that up. It is time to perform standardization in Python.scaler = StandardScaler()df_std = scaler.fit_transform(df)Now, We are all set to start building segmentation model K-Means!df_std = pd.DataFrame(data = df_std,columns = df.columns)Building Our Segmentation ModelBefore applying the K-Means algorithm we need to choose how many clusters we would like to have.But How?There are two components. Within Clusters Sum of Squares(WCSS) and Elbow Method.wcss = []for i in range(1,11): kmeans_pca = KMeans(n_clusters = i, init = 'k-means++', random_state = 42) kmeans_pca.fit(scores_pca) wcss.append(kmeans_pca.inertia_)We stored to each within clusters sum of squared value to wcss list.Let’s visualize them.plt.figure(figsize = (10,8))plt.plot(range(1, 11), wcss, marker = 'o', linestyle = '-.',color='red')plt.xlabel('Number of Clusters')plt.ylabel('WCSS')plt.title('K-means Clustering')plt.show()The elbow in the graph is the four-cluster mark. This is the only place until which the graph is steeply declining while smoothing out afterward.Let’s perform K-Means clustering with 4 clusters.kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters = 4, init = 'k-means++', random_state = 42)Fitting Our Model to the Datasetkmeans.fit(df_std)# We create a new data frame with the original features and add a new column with the assigned clusters for each point.df_segm_kmeans= df_std.copy()df_std[‘Segment K-means’] = kmeans.labels_We now see the segments with our dataset.Let’s group the customers by clusters and see the average values for each variable.df_segm_analysis = df_std.groupby(['Segment K-means']).mean()df_segm_analysisIt’s time to interpret our new dataset,Let’s start with the first segment,It has almost the same number of men and women with an average age of 56. Compared to other clusters, we realize that this is the oldest segment.For the second segment, we can say,This segment has the lowest values for the annual salary.They live almost exclusively in small citiesWith low income living in small cities, it seems that this is a segment of people with fewer opportunities.Let’s carry on with the third segment,This is the youngest segment with an average age of 29. They have medium level of education and average income.They also seem average about every parameter we can label the segment average or standard.Finally, we come to the fourth segment,It is comprised almost entirely of men, less than 20 percent of whom are in relationships.Looking at the numbers, we observe relatively low values for education, paired with high values for income and occupation.The majority of this segment lives in big or middle-sized cities.Let’s label the segment according to their relevance.df_segm_analysis.rename({0:'well-off', 1:'fewer-opportunities', 2:'standard', 3:'career focused'})Finally, we can create our plot to visualize each segment.x_axis = df_std['Age']y_axis = df_std['Income']plt.figure(figsize = (10, 8))sns.scatterplot(x_axis, y_axis, hue = df_std['Labels'], palette = ['g', 'r', 'c', 'm'])plt.title('Segmentation K-means')plt.show()We can see the green segment well off is clearly separated as it is highest in both age and income. But the other three are grouped together.We can conclude that K-Means did a decent job! However, it’s hard to separate segments from each other.In the next section, we will combine PCA and K-Means to try to get a better result.PCA with K-Means for Better VisualizationWhat we will do here is apply dimensionality reduction to simplify our problem.We will choose reasonable components in order to obtain a better clustering solution than with the standard K-Means. So that We aim to see a nice and clear plot for our segmented groups.pca = PCA()pca.fit(df_std) Now, Let’s see the explained variance ratio by each component.pca.explained_variance_ratio_We observe that the first component explains around 36 % of the variability of the data. The second one is 26 % and so on.We now can plot the cumulative sum of explained variance.plt.figure(figsize = (12,9))plt.plot(range(1,8), pca.explained_variance_ratio_.cumsum(), marker = 'o', linestyle = '--')plt.title('Explained Variance by Components')plt.xlabel('Number of Components')plt.ylabel('Cumulative Explained Variance')Well, How do we choose the right number of components? The answer is there is no right or wrong answer for that.But, a rule of thumb is to keep at least 70 to 80 percent of the explained variance.80 % of the variance of the data is explained by the first 3 components. Let’s keep the first 3 components for our further analysis.pca = PCA(n_components = 3)pca.fit(df_std)pca.components_The result is a 3 by 7 array. We reduced our futures to three components from the original seven values that explain the shape the values themselves show the so-called loadings.Hey, just a minute, what is loading then?Loadings are correlations between an original variable and the component.For instance, the first value of the array shows the loading of the first feature on the first component.Let’s put this information in a pandas data frame so that we can see them nicely. Columns are seven original features and rows are three components that PCA gave us.df_pca_comp = pd.DataFrame(data = pca.components_, columns = df.columns, index = ['Component 1', 'Component 2', 'Component 3'])df_pca_compplt.figure(figsize=(12,9))sns.heatmap(df_pca_comp, vmin = -1, vmax = 1, cmap = 'RdBu', annot = True)plt.yticks([0, 1, 2], ['Component 1', 'Component 2', 'Component 3'], rotation = 45, fontsize = 12)plt.title('Components vs Original Features',fontsize = 14)plt.show()We see that there is a positive correlation between Component1 and Age,Income, Occupation and Settlement size. These are strictly related to the career of a person. So this component shows the career focus of the individual.For the second component Sex, Marital status and Education are by far the most prominent determinants.For the final component, we realize that Age, Marital Status, and Occupation are the most important features. We observed that marital status and occupation load negatively but are still important.Now, we have an idea about our new variables(components). We can clearly see the relationship between components and variables.Let’s transform our data and save it scores_pca.pca.transform(df_std)scores_pca = pca.transform(df_std)K-means clustering with PCAOur new dataset is ready! It’s time to apply K-Means to our brand new dataset with 3 components.It is as simple as before! We follow the same steps with standard K-Means.wcss = []for i in range(1,11): kmeans_pca = KMeans(n_clusters = i, init = 'k-means++', random_state = 42) kmeans_pca.fit(scores_pca) wcss.append(kmeans_pca.inertia_)We see that the optimal cluster number by within sum of square is 4.kmeans_pca = KMeans(n_clusters = 4, init = 'k-means++', random_state = 42)kmeans_pca.fit(scores_pca)K-Means algorithm has learnt from our new components and created 4 clusters . I would like to see old datasets with new components and labels .df_segm_pca_kmeans = pd.concat([df.reset_index(drop = True), pd.DataFrame(scores_pca)], axis = 1)df_segm_pca_kmeans.columns.values[-3: ] = ['Component 1', 'Component 2', 'Component 3']df_segm_pca_kmeans['Segment K-means PCA'] = kmeans_pca.labels_df_segm_pca_kmeans.head()# We calculate the means by segments.df_segm_pca_kmeans_freq = df_segm_pca_kmeans.groupby(['Segment K-means PCA']).mean()df_segm_pca_kmeans_freqAbove we see our data grouped by K-Means Segment. We can also convert segment numbers to the label and see the observation number and proportions of each segment by total observation.df_segm_pca_kmeans_freq['N Obs'] = df_segm_pca_kmeans[['Segment K-means PCA','Sex']].groupby(['Segment K-means PCA']).count()df_segm_pca_kmeans_freq['Prop Obs'] = df_segm_pca_kmeans_freq['N Obs'] / df_segm_pca_kmeans_freq['N Obs'].sum()df_segm_pca_kmeans_freq = df_segm_pca_kmeans_freq.rename({0:'standard', 1:'career focused', 2:'fewer opportunities', 3:'well-off'})df_segm_pca_kmeans_freqWe obtained columns and changed the name with a few line of codes.Now, Let’s plot the our new segments and see differences.As you can probably recall, our previous four clusters were standard,career focused, fewer opportunities.df_segm_pca_kmeans['Legend'] = df_segm_pca_kmeans['Segment K-means PCA'].map({0:'standard', 1:'career focused', 2:'fewer opportunities', 3:'well-off'})x_axis = df_segm_pca_kmeans['Component 2']y_axis = df_segm_pca_kmeans['Component 1']plt.figure(figsize = (10, 8))sns.scatterplot(x_axis, y_axis, hue = df_segm_pca_kmeans['Legend'], palette = ['g', 'r', 'c', 'm'])plt.title('Clusters by PCA Components')plt.show()When we plotted the K means clustering solution without PCA, we were only able to distinguish the green segment, but the division based on the components is much more pronounced.That was one of the biggest goals of PCA to reduce the number of variables by combining them into bigger ones.“Don’t find customers for your products, find products for your customers.”— Seth GodinConclusionWe segmented our customers into 4 groups. We are ready to start to choose our groups based on our aims and marketing them!Segmentation helps marketers to be more efficient in terms of time, money and other resources.They gain a better understanding of customer's needs and wants and therefore can tailor campaigns to customer segments most likely to purchase products.If you want to see the entire code in Jupyter notebook, it can be found on my Github.Thanks for reading!Not sure what to read?

Deciphering Marketing ROI: Exploring Multi-Touch Attribution Models with Python and Probabilistic Approaches (Part 2) | by VAIBHAV GANDOTRA | Mar, 2024 | MediumOpen in appSign upSign inWriteSign upSign inDeciphering Marketing ROI: Exploring Multi-Touch Attribution Models with Python and Probabilistic Approaches (Part 2)VAIBHAV GANDOTRA·Follow4 min read·Mar 2, 2024--ListenShare“Education must inspire the faith that each of us has both the power and the responsibility to effect positive change on a global scale” — Daisaku IkedaSource: GoogleIntroductionIn this article, we continue talking about various marketing channels and how you can optimize your budget across various channels to get the maximum conversion for your business. In the previous article, we read about single-touch attribution models and saw an example. Now, let’s understand the concept behind multi-touch attribution models.Multi-Touch Attribution ModelsMulti-touch attribution models have become important for marketers, especially those looking to measure the impact of digital campaigns. The models look at various channels through which customer engages with the product and assign a particular %age to each one based on the model. These models should be used when the number of channels for a particular campaign is between 5 and 10. Majorly, there are 3 — models:Linear Attribution Model: Under this model, all the channels, that a customer visits are assigned equal credits in case of a conversion.Position-Based (U-shaped) Attribution Model: This model is called the U-shaped model because the first and last channels the customer visits are assigned 40% credit each and the remaining 20% is spread out between any other interactions in the middle.Position Decay Attribution Model: This model uses an algorithm, and allocates credits to all the channels, used to convert, giving the credit in reverse order. The highest score is attributed to the last channel and the least to the first channel.DatasetDataset we will be working on!The dataset will be the same as for the previous article. The ‘Conversion’ column takes the value ‘0’ or ‘1’. The ‘Conversion_Value’ denotes the amount spent by a customer in dollars. ‘Channel’ takes values — ‘Instagram’, ‘Paid Search’, ‘Online Display’, ‘Facebook’, & ‘Online Video’.ModulesThe modules used in the model are Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas-Profiling, Matplotlib, Collections, and SeabornU-shaped Attribution ModelSource:GoogleThe U-shaped attribution model is favored in situations where there are multiple touchpoints in the customer journey. The initial and final touchpoints are given equal and maximum weightage while acknowledging the intermediate touchpoints' role. Specifically, 40% credit is given to 1st and last touchpoints each, and the rest is equally distributed among the intermediate touchpoints. Practically, It can be applied when number of channels is between 5 and 10.def calc_attribution(click_pos,total_clicks): #Assigning weightage according to the position of the channel default_att = 0.5 #if a user has visited only 2 channels extreme_touch_att_1 = 0.4 #Assigining weightage to first and last channels intermed_att_1 = 0.2 #Total weightage for remaining channels if total_clicks == 2: return default_att elif total_clicks == 1: return 1 else: if click_pos == total_clicks or click_pos ==1: return extreme_touch_att_1 else: return intermed_att_1/(total_clicks-2) #Giving equal weightage to all the mid channels from the remaining 20%def calc_attribution(click_pos,total_clicks): #Assigning weightage according to the position of the channel default_att = 0.5 #if a user has visited only 2 channels extreme_touch_att_1 = 0.4 #Assigining weightage to first and last channels intermed_att_1 = 0.2 #Total weightage for remaining channels if total_clicks == 2: return default_att elif total_clicks == 1: return 1 else: if click_pos == total_clicks or click_pos ==1: return extreme_touch_att_1 else: return intermed_att_1/(total_clicks-2) #Giving equal weightage to all the mid channels from the remaining 20%ResultsResultsAs we run the model on the given dataset and print the results, we get the following table. Unlike the last touch attribution model, this model Paid Search is leading with 27.48% credit, followed by Online Display at 26.61%. Online Video is the least ranked in this scenario. Instagram and Facebook get ~16% credit each. As we take cumulative results from many models, the bias reduces. In the next article we’ll talk about Probabilistic Attribution Models and their concepts.PythonMarketingMarketing StrategiesData ScienceMarketing Automation----FollowWritten by VAIBHAV GANDOTRA43 FollowersUndergraduate student at BITS Pilani | EngineerFollowHelpStatusAboutCareersBlogPrivacyTermsText to speechTeams

Unlimited wisdom and ardent resolve arise from a sense of responsibility” — Daisaku IkedaSource: GoogleIntroductionMost online businesses look to increase the traffic on their websites, applications, and retail. They tend to showcase their business to various potential customers via different marketing channels like Instagram, Facebook, Paid Search, YouTube ads, etc. It helps them showcase their products/services and increase their business. Though conversions through paid channels are more visible, it is important to optimize your budget on various channels by focusing on the ‘conversion rate’ and ‘conversion value’ of each channel and only retaining those with high ROI. There are various methods to understand conversion rate; some models are: ‘Single Touch Attribution Models’, ‘Multi-Touch Attribution Models & And ‘Probabilistic Attribution Models’. We will look at one Single Touch Attribution Model in this articleSingle Touch Attribution ModelsAs evident by the name, these models majorly focus on a single channel for conversion. There are 3 types of single-touch attribution models:Last-Touch Attribution Model: The model focuses on giving 100% credit to the last touch point, i.e., the channel through which conversion happened, ignoring all the other channels dataFirst-Touch Attribution Model: The model focuses on giving 100% credit to the first touch point, i.e., for a customer with conversion, the first channel is known to which the customer was exposed.Last-Non-Direct Touch Attribution Model: The model focuses on giving 100% credit to the 2nd last touch point in the whole chain before conversionDatasetDatasetsWe will be using the above-shown dataset for a business say ‘ABC’. Each unique customer has a unique ‘cookie’. We can see the results of various ads in terms of ‘conversion’ & ‘conversion_value’ and the channel through which it was converted. Now that we have understood the Dataset; let's start with Last Touch Attribution ModelModulesThe modules used in the models are Pandas, Pandas-profiling, matplotlib, NumPy, Seaborn, itertools, and gekko.Last Touch Attribution ModelAs explained above, the model focuses on giving 100% credit to the last touch point, i.e., the channel through which conversion happened, ignoring all the other channels data. It disregards any number of channels previously visited by user. Practically , it can be applied when number of channels are 5 or less.def last_touch_model(dt, conv_col, channel_col): import pandas as pd last_touch = dt.loc[dt[conv_col]==1] res_last_touch=pd.DataFrame(round(last_touch[channel_col].value_counts(normalize=True)*100,2)) res_last_touch.columns=['Weightage(%)'] return res_last_touchAbove given is the function of res_last_touch,last_touch: It first extracts the rows for which conv_col==1res_last_touch: the function ‘value_counts(normalize=True)*100….’ calculates the frequency of each unique value of ‘channel_col’ and normalizes it in percentage format. The ‘…,2’ denoted is used to round up the value to 2 decimal placespd.DataFrame(……): It converts the resulting series of rounded %age into a Data Frame named as res_last_touchResultsResults on the dataset from last_touch_modelAs we run the model on the given dataset and print the results, we get the following table. We can draw inferences from the given table that Facebook ranks the highest visited last touch channel for customers with conversion. It is followed by Paid Search and Online Video with 25.78% and 19.32% respectively. Instagram and Online Displays together constitute 24.85% of weightage. This is one of the models. To minimize the bias and get fair results we will use many more models and combine the results.PythonMarketingMarketing StrategiesData ScienceMarketing Automation----FollowWritten by VAIBHAV GANDOTRA43 FollowersUndergraduate student at BITS Pilani | EngineerFollowHelpStatusAboutCareersBlogPrivacyTermsText to speechTeams 
Marketing Attribution Data Model for B2b company. | by Vladimir Kobzev | Apr, 2024 | MediumOpen in appSign upSign inWriteSign upSign inMarketing Attribution Data Model for B2b company.Vladimir Kobzev·Follow7 min read·3 days ago--ListenShareMy Previous Medium post: what is marketing attribution, what is uniq for b2b, and how might it be helpful?Here is the big picture with maximum complexity in case you use more than one web analytics events source simultaneously: ga4 and Mixpanel, additional custom spreadsheets (for the outbound and offline conferences and other input), and 20+ paid ad channels.Marketing Attribution Data Transformation LineageContent: Events data extraction. Events Mapping to Revenue Big Table. Events from entities. Match Sales|Revenue data from CRM. Attribution metrics calculation.Data ExtractionGoogle Analytics.Btw. If you use GA4, please don’t forget to set up the user ID. GuideHere is a step-by-step setup to get events from ga4 to BigQuery.And here is a code on how to make single datasets from daily partitions across multiple ga4 propertiesHere is code on how to extract event datetime to readable formatI like to build attribution on ClikcHouse. If you also like it. Here is the type of cast that you need to do for this extraction. Here is the code for preparing data to send to clickhouse. Or you can use airbyte as a connector to BigQuery or via gcsMixpanelRow Events Export endpoint. You can export it to BigQuery or Clickhouse.Offline|Sales Events ExtractionFor SalesFource, HubSpot, ZohoCRM, NetSuite, and whatever CRM you can use:Airbyte. Salesforce, Hubspot.Estudiary. SalesForce, HubspotImprovado. If you don’t want to spend engineers’ time to set upBefore moving to mapping events to One Big Table, I need to explain why it is so cool and how it saves hours, days, weeks, and maybe years of engineering.Introducing: “Revenue Big Table”. The Batman to Fight Marketing Attribution Nightmare.Challenge. Let me introduce a classic data engineer nightmare: “The sales team decided to add a field to salesforce that needs to be used for output calculations.” This is it. It causes enormous work to pass the field from the beginning to the end of the calculation.Solution. With the genius idea of Activity Schema. I think “Revenue Big Table” could be a good name for the attribution use case. Rows examples:Revenue Big Table. Few rows exampleHere is the Data contracts for the Revenue Big Table Structure spec:BigQuery data contract ymlClickhouse data contract ymlEvent IdData quality: Ensure that the Event ID is uniq and suitable for many things. Make this test a priority.Activity. The field that Defines Business Logic.Every type of activity usually has its usual features. For example, “Web View” has source info, and “Sales Qualified” has “opportunity amount.”Data Quality Monitoring Practice. It’s good practice to have an explicit list of “expected activities” And an alert if a new name is added. But Please! don’t Restrict or filter wrong names. It reduces QA possibilities a lot. Just imagine how cool it is to realize that data is incorrect because the GA4 changed the spec or the sales team changed the stage name.Prospect ID.Standard options: domain, email, CRM_account_id, or ga4_user_id.It might be a more complicated synthetic ID. For example, hash that solves situations like if there is CRM_account_id, we use it; if not, we use ga4_user_idData Quality: no rows with empty Prospect IDs are good.FeaturesThe best feature structure for features is a Map(Key, Value).Clickhouse does have it, but BigQuery doesn’t. But gbq has array of tuples. I wrote simple code for the dbt function (macros) that accesses the feature by key. I decided to avoid working in JSON here. BC of global climate change AI asked me to reduce string parsing as reasonably as possible.BTW. Snowflake and Databrikc do have a map() as a type.Features Data Quality: check that the existent feature keys list matches the Activity type. For example, “Web Event” shouldn’t have: “Sales Engineer”.Source Table NameThis is a valuable field for debugging. And since debugging is the king. We need it.Marketing Channels MappingSearch Organic. Dividing “Non-Brand Organic” and “Brand Organic” is good in almost all cases. An organic brand usually brings traffic only to a few pages, so the logic to detect organic brands is to check this short list of landings.Move to channel mapping out of data model code because marketers need to check this and sometimes correct details.Here is a working example of marketing channel mapping in google spreadsheet. With code for BigQuery and ClickhouseMapping source tables to Revenue Big TableAfter all this preparation is done, GPT writes mapping itself quite well. You need to provide:For a few rows of the table, you need to mapRevenue Big Bable data contracts.Features mapping. like “opp_sum” -> “opportunity_amount_usd”. This is the only thing to check carefully because it should be coordinated across various sources.Events From Entities. Reverse Data engineering.First, after moving to the Activity schema idea, I felt excellent. But then, one needed for the input table isn’t about events. I did one join above, then another not events table. Finally, I realized that Joker won. And there is no value in a single data contract anymore.But, sometime later, I decided to map entities as events.In data engineering, it refers to the concept of Accumulating snapshots in Kimble Dimensional Modeling.Match Sales|Revenue data from CRM with web dataUse cases when you need it:Three months after the web event with traffic source, you have an event in CRM with Revenue amount.Or you have many stages: Marketing Qualified, Sales Qualified, Proposal, … and need to attribute marketing channels to these events as goals.There are two options to solve these use cases:Send some web analytics-user_id to CRM.Send CRM user_id to web-analyticsSending web analytics-user_id to CRMThis is a much more complicated to implement case than the second one. But since this option looks more intuitive, we have to disclose it.Pushing web analytics user_id to CRMis how it could be implementedfirst; you need to get a web analytics user_id. Here is the javascript code that gets Google Analytics 4 user_idThen, you need to add this web analytics user id to the CRM event. Here is a code example for adding Google user_id as a property to the Hubspot contactWhy could it be tricky? In this particular case with HubSpot, it’s pretty straightforward. However, for Salesforce, these frontend API requests might require a customer solution that depends on specific API configuration, which might take some significant time.Sending CRM user_id to web analytics trackerCRM user_id to web analyticsIf your user email plays the role of crm_user_id, then it might not be a good idea to push it to web analytics. I recommend a hashed email (for privacy compliance, first of all)Here is what you need to set it up:Hash email (or another CRM user ID). Code exampleSend CRM user_id to the data layer. Example for WordPress gravity formsCatch user_id from the data layer. Example of doing it via Google Tag Manager and Google Analytics 4variable set up. Go: https://tagmanager.google.com/Google Tag Manager hashed email as a data layer variable set upAnd push the email hash to ga4. In this screenshot, we named the hashed email user_id (I think it was the wrong idea).Push hashed email to Google Analytics 4 set up.Attribution metrics calculationStandard requirements for marketing attribution model:Attribution Window. Some old interactions don’t need to be attributed. In our case, we don’t attribute old paid visits from Facebook.Exclude events after sales interaction started. For example, clicking from a call invitation email could be a noise when making decisions.Here is the dbt models lineage that calculates attribution metrics from the revenue big table that comply the data contractThere is a google spreadsheet with all the params that need to be set up:marketing_channel_featuresmarketing_and_sales_goalsgsheet_marketing_attribution_coded_paramsVladimir.P.S: Like it?

Marketing Analytics: Everything You Need to Know | OWOX BI | MediumOpen in appSign upSign inWriteSign upSign inThe Art of Marketing Analytics: A Deep DiveLearn how you can optimize campaigns, gain insights, and optimize ROI with marketing analytics. Explore key strategies and tools.OWOX·Follow13 min read·Mar 14, 2024--ListenShareWelcome to the world of marketing analytics — the simple way to revolutionize your marketing strategies. In this comprehensive guide, we introduce the world of data, providing you with the knowledge and tools to use its full potential for optimizing marketing performance. Let’s dive right in so you win the marketing game.What is marketing analytics?Marketing analytics is the process of collecting, measuring, analyzing, and interpreting data related to marketing efforts. It involves using data and statistical analysis to evaluate the performance of marketing campaigns, strategies, and channels to make informed decisions and optimize future marketing efforts.Marketing data analytics usually includes 3 core components: analyzing the present, reporting on the past, and predicting the future.Track present in real-time: Marketers need to correctly evaluate the effectiveness of the current campaigns and activities to get a clear picture of where their current marketing efforts are and to compare them to data from past campaigns. In this case, they’ll be focused on ads performance, website traffic, source/medium breakdown, social media engagement, user behavior, and click-through rate, as well as the current state of the orders or revenue metrics.Consider the past: Marketing leaders and their teams also rely on marketing analytics reporting about completed campaigns, or just the history of the campaign performance, focusing on the conversion and retention metrics, such as customer lifetime value (LTV), average revenue per user (ARPU) or sales funnel churn rate.Predict the future: Last but not least, marketers should be able to use past experience, and results to predict the performance of future campaigns or projects. This is typically about conversion modeling, lead scoring, content distribution, and upselling opportunities and relies on the data that is already collected, as well as modeling, machine learning (ML), or artificial intelligence (AI).Let’s summarize this: Marketing analytics plays a crucial role in helping businesses understand their customers, grow ROI, and reach their marketing goals.Important to note: Marketing analytics doesn’t directly influence ROI, but that’s the most efficient way to save your time and make informed decisions to reduce ad waste, optimize the most profitable campaigns, and as a result — boost ROI.Key Components of Marketing AnalyticsData CollectionMarketing analytics starts with collecting relevant data. You can collect all sorts of data from multiple sources such as advertising platforms, on-site analytics tools, social media, email marketing tools, and CRM systems. It’s very important because analytics is always about data, as the main unit of information.Real-Time User Behavior TrackingTracking user behavior in real time is essential for comprehensive marketing analytics. It provides insights into how users interact with your digital assets: visiting the web pages, clicking the CTA buttons, filling out the forms, or making a payment. Analytics is about tracking and it’s crucial for an effective marketing strategy.Data ProcessingOnce data is collected, it needs to be processed and organized into a format that is suitable for analysis. This often involves transforming data into a business-ready format, ensuring uniformity and compatibility among different data sources. Analytics is about the system and it should be holistic, built upon the harmonization of various data elements.Reporting and VisualizationOnce data is unified, consistent, and matchable — it’s time for data visualization. Visual, aesthetically pleasing reports facilitate the communication of insights and findings to stakeholders within your team or organization, expediting decision-making processes.Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)But what are the metrics that should be calculated and visualized?Сommon marketing metrics include conversion rates between funnel stages, cost per click, cost per lead, cost per order, and more. By the end of the day, there are just 3 main KPIs for most of the businesses:Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)Return on Investment (ROI).These metrics serve as critical benchmarks because analytics is about measuring marketing efforts and effectiveness.If you’re eager to explore these KPIs further and gain a deeper understanding of how they can steer your marketing strategies, we invite you to watch this webinar recording:InsightsMarketing analytics empowers businesses with a deeper understanding of their target audience. It provides insights into customer behavior, preferences, demographics, and geographical data.Armed with this knowledge, businesses can transform data into actionable insights and tailor their marketing strategies to align with customer needs, ensuring that the right message reaches the right person in the right place at the right time.Marketing data analytics is about decisions — and ideally, if those decisions are backed with trusted data.OptimizationRelying on insights and campaign metrics, businesses can optimize their marketing strategies, e.g., optimize cross-channel budget allocation. By identifying what works and what doesn’t, resources can be allocated more effectively, and overall marketing performance can be enhanced. Marketing decisions will be ideally data-backed.Marketing AttributionMarketing attribution plays a vital role when multiple touchpoints drive the conversion. For instance, if a customer interacted with a Google ad, a Facebook ad, a few emails, a LinkedIn ad, and a personal phone call before converting, each of these touchpoints should be rewarded with a portion of the sale amount. A proper attribution model ensures the most accurate assessment of marketing channels’ effectiveness (for your specific business needs).If you’d like to learn more about how you can get the marketing attribution model your business needs, and how to evaluate an incremental value of each paid click check out THIS webinar so you are equipped with the knowledge to drive campaign performance and maximize ROI.Predictive AnalyticsPredictive analytics leverages historical data to forecast future trends and outcomes. It aids in making informed decisions, optimizing campaigns, anticipating customer behavior, demand forecasting, risk assessment, and marketing trends prediction. Incorporating predictive analytics into your strategy allows you to enlarge your marketing effectiveness and success in an ever-evolving business landscape.For an in-depth dive into this topic, we recently hosted a webinar on “How conversion modeling helps to measure marketing efficiency in a post-cookie world”. If you missed it, don’t worry! You can catch the recording here:Marketing analytics is an iterative and never-ending process. Businesses constantly gather and analyze data to refine their marketing strategies and adapt to changing market conditions.The ultimate goal is to increase sales and revenue, making analytics a part of every business operation.Why your brand needs marketing analyticsIn today’s competitive landscape, marketing analytics is no longer optional; it’s essential. It empowers brands to make correct business decisions, save time on data preparation, increase ROI and revenue, create targeted strategies, and detect and address potential issues before they escalate.Marketing analytics enables data-driven marketing, ultimately leading to improved results.Make correct business decisionsMarketing analytics empowers you to make informed decisions that are both quantitative and qualitative. For instance, it helps you decide on crucial aspects like cross-channel or cross-campaign budget allocation, ensuring your resources are optimally distributed for maximum impact.Save time on data preparationWith marketing analytics, you can bid farewell to the tedious task of data preparation, freeing up valuable time that can be better spent on creative endeavors and strategic decision-making. It’s time to focus on aspects that can’t be outsourced, like crafting compelling campaigns and strategies.Grow ROI & revenueThe quality of your data directly impacts your decisions. Bad data leads to poor decisions, wasting your time and resources. In contrast, marketing analytics enables you to harness quality data, resulting in better decisions, increased revenue, higher profits, and ultimately, improved return on investment (ROI).Create targeted strategiesWith marketing analytics, you gain the ability to craft targeted strategies. By delivering the right message to the right audience at the right time and place, you can significantly enhance your conversion rates. Don’t miss the opportunity to leverage the power of mass personalization.Detect small problems before they become bigMarketing analytics acts as your early warning system, allowing you to spot and address small issues before they escalate into major problems. This means you can identify inefficient ad spend that may appear profitable on the surface but is wasting valuable resources.How to correctly evaluate the effectiveness of marketing investmentEvaluating the effectiveness of marketing investments involves multiple strategies. The goal is to assess ROI accurately and make data-driven decisions. To estimate the effectiveness of your marketing investment, it’s crucial to analyze various aspects of your campaigns. Here are key methods and considerations:Campaign Performance AnalysisYou need to understand what worked, and what didn’t, and how to improve future campaigns for fine-tuning marketing strategy and maximizing ROI. During this analysis, key performance indicators (KPIs) are closely scrutinized to assess the impact of each campaign. You should closely watch such metrics as conversion rates, click-through rates, return on ad spend (ROAS), and cost per acquisition (CPA).This aims to identify which campaigns delivered the best results and which may need adjustments or reallocation of resources.Cross-Channel ReportCross-channel reporting is your window into the collective performance of various marketing channels. This holistic perspective empowers data-driven decision-making and optimization of your marketing efforts. Look comprehensively at your marketing efforts across all channels, providing insights into how each channel contributes to your overall strategy.Create a unified report that consolidates data from all marketing sources and platforms. The power of a cross-channel report lies in its visual representation. Charts, graphs, and visualizations make it easy to spot trends, anomalies, and areas for improvement across your entire marketing ecosystem.Marketing AttributionApply different attribution models to your data and evaluate the attribution models to help you understand the impact of different marketing channels on conversions. Different models distribute credit to various touchpoints differently.Standard attribution models include:First Click: Attributes all credit to the first interaction.Last Non-Direct Click: Attributes credit to the last interaction that was not direct.Linear: Distributes credit equally across all touchpoints.Time Decay: Gives more credit to recent touchpoints.U-shaped (Position Based): Attributes more credit to the first and last interactions, with less for intermediate ones.Experiment with different attribution models to find the one that best aligns with your business goals and use marketing dashboards to make the decision-making process easier.When creating marketing dashboards, keep these principles in mind:Visualization: Focus on visualizing key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics that directly impact your marketing goals.Automation: Ensure that your dashboards are automated. Your analytics solution should collect, process, and store data, then prepare it for reporting and visualization automatically. This ensures that your dashboards provide real-time insights without manual intervention.Report by product categoryFor businesses with a diverse product range, analyzing performance by product category is crucial. This approach provides granular insights into which product lines are thriving and which may need extra attention. Metrics like sales volume, conversion rates, and revenue generated can help you understand which categories are performing best.Allocate resources to categories that are performing well, identify opportunities for cross-selling or upselling, and address underperforming categories with targeted marketing efforts.RFM AnalysisRFM analysis stands for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary analysis, a technique that helps businesses understand their customers’ behavior in-depth. You may consider analyzing customer segments based on how recently they made a purchase, how often they buy, and how much they spend.This helps in targeting high-value customers and tailoring marketing efforts to different segments. Try out a template for RFM analysis.Cohort AnalysisCohort analysis is a powerful tool for understanding how different groups of customers behave over time. Instead of looking at all customers as a single entity, cohort analysis divides them into smaller groups based on common characteristics or events. It helps you understand the unique life cycles of different customer groups, enabling you to make data-driven decisions.By applying cohort analysis, you can refine your marketing strategies, boost customer retention, measure ad performance, and ultimately enhance your business’s long-term success.Improve marketing effectiveness with analytics tool by OWOX BIGrowing Your ROI with 3 Main Marketing Analytics DriversTo enhance your return on investment (ROI) using marketing analytics, it’s essential to focus on key drivers that can drive better results. Below we’ve collected three primary drivers. By implementing these drivers effectively, you can not only improve your marketing ROI but also make data-driven decisions that lead to more successful and efficient marketing campaigns.Driver #1: Reduce AdWasteCross-Channel Budget AllocationEfficiently allocate your budget across different marketing channels and campaigns based on your performance.Identify which campaigns generate the highest ROI and reallocate resources from underperforming ones. This should be based on user behavior and sales data from your CRM rather than just ad platform data (e.g., Facebook ads, and LinkedIn ads).Effort OptimizationOptimize your efforts across non-paid channels like social media marketing, email marketing, and content marketing. You don’t have to pay to share your message, but there is a hidden cost of content creation.Identify the most effective channels and allocate your team’s efforts and resources accordingly.Driver #2: Behavior InsightsWhen you collect on-site analytics, with tools like Google Analytics 4 or OWOX BI Streaming, you get the data about how your visitors are acting on your site.Audience Segmentation and TargetingSegment your audience into distinct groups based on their behavior and preferences. Target these segments with tailored marketing messages and campaigns that align with their specific needs.PersonalizationCustomize marketing content and messages for individual customers based on their preferences and behaviors. Personalization often leads to higher engagement and conversion rates.Conversion Rate OptimizationAnalyze user behavior data to understand how users move through the sales funnel and identify where they drop off.

Researchers found that it changes both the quantity and content of the feedback. by Kaitlin Woolley and Marissa A. Sharif by Kaitlin Woolley and Marissa A. Sharif June 25, 2021 HBR Staff/Viktar Lameika/ hudiemm/Getty Images Post Post Share Annotate Save Get PDF Buy Copies Print Summary. The vast majority of consumers read product reviews before making an online purchase, suggesting that most of us understand the value of honest, accurate reviews. Nevertheless, new research suggests that if you offer a financial incentive to customers in exchange for writing the review, they’re significantly more likely to write a positive review — even though the incentive is not at all contingent on the content of the review. Based on a series of studies, the authors found that offering an incentive as low as $0.20 or $1.00 increased the positivity of reviews by 40 to 70%. That said, the authors also note some situations in which incentives aren’t effective: Specifically, they won’t work to counteract negative sentiment in the face of a major public scandal, and they can also backfire if new customers feel that the reviews are positive to the point of inaccuracy. But in general, this research suggests that offering a financial incentive can be an effective strategy to help companies source more positive reviews. Post Post Share Annotate Save Get PDF Buy Copies Print If someone paid you to review a product, would you be more likely to write a positive review or a negative one? You might think that a financial incentive shouldn’t have any impact. After all, the purpose of product reviews is to provide honest feedback. Ninety-three percent of U.S. adults read reviews before making online purchases, suggesting that the vast majority of consumers understand the benefits of reliable reviews and would be motivated to write accurate ones themselves.
