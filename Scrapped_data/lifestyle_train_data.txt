What’s fascinating is I always find interesting topics I can talk about.Video games appeared in the seventies, and they continue to spread significantly; where some consider them a fun way to spend time only, increasing evidence proves that they are far from just a means of entertainment or to improve hand-eye coordination. We mention the following :1-Improve the performance of SurgeonsIf you are going to have surgery, you may be tempted to consult the doctor with the latest medical research instead of spending time playing video games — you need to reconsider — while laparoscopic surgery specialists have proven through minor incision procedures that the errors of those who played for more than three hours a week are 32% lower than others.Why do we Like Challenges and Risks?Do you like taking risks?medium.com2-Help eliminates dyslexia.Some research has pointed to attention difficulties being a key component of dyslexia, and one study of intensive courses on video games conducted on people with reading difficulties has shown a noticeable improvement in their reading skills, where researchers expressed that this is due to the constantly changing gaming environment that requires intense concentration.3-Help improve vision.Parents often use the famous saying, “Don’t sit too close to the TV,” although no scientific reference suggests this. At the same time, scientists have discovered games that improve vision and not overwork it. A 10-week study of toys showed a remarkable ability to distinguish between shades of gray. At the same time, another study assigned participants to try to play using only the “lazy eye “with” healthy eye blocking.

Sufficient and quality sleep helps the body fight off infections, viruses, and diseases more effectively, reducing the likelihood of falling ill and promoting faster recovery.Reasons for not getting enough sleep:Stress and Anxiety:High levels of stress or tension can make it tough to relax and fall asleep. Random thoughts and overthinking can keep the mind active, thereby preventing a restful sleep.Poor Sleep Habits:Not maintaining sleep schedules, bedtime routines and not following proper sleep hygiene guidelines can affect body’s natural sleep and quality.Electronic Devices and Screen Time:This is one of the most common causes of not getting a good sleep. Use of mobile phones, computers or tablets may result in getting a poor sleep. Those blue lights emitted by devices, suppresses melatonin production, and stimulates the brain, thereby making it harder to sleep.Environmental Factors:Noise from traffic, high volume tv sounds from neighbours, or snoring partners can disturb your sleep, while bright lights or an uncomfortable mattress along with pillows could make harder for a good sleep.Medical Conditions:Sleep disorders like insomnia, restless legs syndrome, or chronic pain conditions can disrupt sleep patterns and prevent good sleep.Medications and Substances:Certain medicines or tablets, such as those for allergies, asthma, hypertension, or depression, can affect sleep. Additionally, substances like caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol can disrupt sleep patterns and impair sleep quality.Hormonal Changes:Hormonal fluctuations, such as during pregnancy, menopause, puberty, or menstrual cycles, can disturb sleep patterns and make it harder to stay asleep.Mental Health Disorders:If you are having Stress, anxiety, hypertension, post-traumatic stress disorder or if you are having bipolar disorder, they can impact sleep quality and may lead to insomnia or extra sleepiness.Lifestyle Factors:Unhealthy lifestyle habits, such as excessive caffeine intake, irregular eating patterns, lack of physical activity, or irregular work shifts, can disrupt sleep and negatively affect sleep quality.Age:Sleep patterns change with age. Older adults may experience more frequent awakenings during the night and find it hard to fall asleep. Hormonal changes, medical conditions, and certain medications associated with aging may also affect sleep quality.Consult a doctor if you have problem in sleeping:Talk to your doctor. There could be a medical condition that is intervening with your sleep.Identifying and addressing these factors can help improve sleep quality.

If sleep problems persist, it’s advisable to consult a healthcare professional for further evaluation and guidance.Best practices for getting a good sleep:Stick to a regular sleep schedule:Go to bed and wake up between 6.30–7.30 am, even on weekends.

Avoid watching TV or using devices an hour before bed, as these devices can interfere with sleep.Ensure your bedroom is dark and soundproof:Darkness helps to promote the production of melatonin, a hormone that helps to get sleep. Make the bedroom as dark and noise free as possible. A cool temperature is also a good idea for getting a good sleep.Avoid caffeine and alcohol before bed:Caffeine and alcohol can both interfere with sleep. Caffeine is a stimulant that can make it difficult to fall asleep, while alcoholic drinks could disturb sleep later in the night.Get regular exercise:Regular Exercise can help to improve sleep quality although you should avoid exercising too close before bedtime.Extra tips for getting good sleep:· Make sure your mattress and pillows are having enough comfort.· Avoid napping during the day. Napping at daytime will make difficult for you having a good sleep at night.

10 habits that will get you ahead of 99% of people | ILLUMINATIONOpen in appSign upSign inWriteSign upSign inTen Habits that will get you ahead of 99% of PeopleImprove your life and get ahead of your peers in 10 simple stepsAlexandru Lazar·FollowPublished inILLUMINATION·9 min read·Nov 18, 2023--434ListenSharePhoto by GR Stocks on UnsplashThe concept of habits became extremely popular in the recent years, mostly due to the personal development wave brought up by the Gen Z culture.Also, due to the books that appeared in the recent years, out of which, the most famous and a favorite of mine, Atomic Habits.Mostly, all this movement is about is taking control of your life. People were living on autopilot for so long, adhering to standards imposed by society, doing what needed to be done, without keeping track on how they spend their time.As mental health became something people took seriously, it was inevitable that we would go to the cause of these issues and analyze what we do with our lives, and that is tracking habits.The unrealistic habits movementThe huge talk about habits and attention spent on it, sparked a lot of analysis into high performers, celebrities, CEOs, entrepreneurs, investors and any personality that is even remotely famous or has a following.Out of these podcasts, books and YouTube videos, there appeared a multitude of habits and routines that are not only unsustainable and unrealistic, but they might cause anxiety and strain on the body, which defies the purpose of having them in the first place.So let me tell you something once and for all:You don’t have to wake up at 5am, if that doesn’t work for youYou don’t have to do anything. The one thing you have to do is listen to your mind and body, and choose from these habits only what works for you and brings you a certain benefit.The 10 habits that improved my lifeWhat I planning to give you today is a list of the habits that I have personally picked from the thousands that are popular, implemented, tested and adjusted into my life.The order is completely random. So let’s begin:Have a good sleep hygienePhoto by bruce mars on UnsplashIn my own personal development journey, I was working on multiple aspects of my life: fitness, relationships, nutrition. But I was always leaving sleep as something to tackle on down the road.I was always choosing having fun, partying, watching Netflix, movies, going out, reading, instead of sleeping.While being in a plateau with my gym goals and nutrition, I got a dog. As some of you might know, dogs go to sleep pretty early and don’t tend to sleep in. This forced me to leave parties earlier, prioritize sleep and go to bed earlier because I was woken up pretty early in the morning.They key takeaways here are:Go to bed relatively earlier and wake up earlier (follow the natural circadian rhythm of your body)Sleep for 8 hours (at least 7, at most 9)Wake up at the end of a sleep cycle. Sleep cycles usually take 90 minutes. So set your alarm at the end of a multiple of 90 minutes.Keep your bedroom a bit cooler than the rest of your houseKeep your bedroom dark while you sleepExercise / Workout every dayPhoto by Karsten Winegeart on UnsplashThere are countless studies on the benefits of exercise on your body, both physically and mentally.What I observed with my training was that it gave me a few valuable things:DisciplineStress and Anxiety reliefA purpose / GoalDopamineEnergyMotivationMy training / exercise routine includes 3 or 4 strength training sessions that are no longer than one hour, once a week boxing class / swimming laps and 10.000 steps a day.A great suggestion here based on my trials as a busy individual and studies from other specialists such as Andrew Huberman, it’s best to have these sessions in the morning, before work. This will help keep your energy levels high, avoid the afternoon energy drop, avoid over-caffeinating, keep your motivation high for the day and improve your mood.Whenever you have time to do it, make sure to include it within your habits.Don’t drink coffee for the first 1–2 hours after you wake upPhoto by Fahmi Fakhrudin on UnsplashCoffee is probably your favorite morning ritual, your go to energy source, and I am the same. Giving up coffee is just something I would not do ever.However, over-caffeinating is a real thing and a detrimental one at that. To avoid needing another coffee at lunchtime or in the afternoon, drink your first one 1–2 hours after you wake up.As Atomic Habits describes amazingly, each habit has a cue. Usually, waking up is our signal to go get coffee. To add or remove habits, you need to play around with the cues.For example, I am using the waking up cue, to get dressed and go to the gym. After that, I come home and get ready for work. At 9:00 when I turn on my laptop, that’s my cue to drink my coffee. Usually I wake up at 7:00–7:30 so I have between 1 and 2 hours before my coffee.Use to-do lists to plan your dayPhoto by Kelly Sikkema on UnsplashWhether you do this in the morning, before starting your day or in the evening when you finish your day, this is a very helpful tool.The main benefit I observed about this is that it offloads a lot of mental pressure from myself and I feel less stressed.This is because we are constantly trying to remember and not forget what we have to do. And we keep pressuring us so we don’t miss anything. So write them down, plan it ahead and you can just enjoy the ride and check out your next task.I admit that my work and life doesn’t always make it easy to know ahead what I will do that day, but the solution I found it to add the tasks that I would like to do, that I have to do and I know about. I then use timeboxing to allocate time for them and then add buffer time in between for any ad-hoc things.Use timeboxing to structure your to-do listPhoto by Agê Barros on UnsplashTimeboxing is a technique I have talked about in other articles and that many high performers use, such as Elon Musk.It basically means allocating a timeframe for each task. For example, I read emails from 11:00 to 12:00. During that time, I am only doing that, and nothing else. This ensures that you will not do a half job, and will finish the task with your full attention involved. It will feel a lot more rewarding.Multitasking is the biggest lie you’ve ever been told. Our brain can only truly focus on one thing at the time.Have a self-care routinePhoto by Maddi Bazzocco on UnsplashI admit, this is something that I am struggling with as well. I don’t know if it’s a male thing, but studies show that men are not great at this habit.However, having a self care routine in the morning and in the evening is a powerful habit, besides the skin, hair and wellness benefits.A morning self-care routine will be your cue that the day it’s starting and you can link up another habit after such as going to the gym or running.It will subconsciously prepare you for tasks and will make you feel ready which will increase your productivity, especially if you work from home.An evening routine will be your cue that the day is coming to an end, and will subconsciously signal your brain to unwind and secret more melatonin because it means it’s going to bed.This is a great habit in itself, but even more useful to link up more habits together.Avoid bright light before bedPhoto by Christopher Jolly on UnsplashYour body is naturally programmed to follow a circadian rhythm. In pre-historic times, it used to follow the sunlight. In more modern times, we don’t structure our days based on sunlight, and we are exposed to bright lights from devices up until late at night.As it gets dark and late, our body will start to produce melatonin, the hormone that helps us with sleep. If you watch TV or scroll on your phone before bed, your melatonin production will drop significantly, and it will cause sleep issues such as insomnia or restless sleep.Read every dayPhoto by Lilly Rum on UnsplashI know you’ve heard this a lot but let me explain.I don’t agree with other pieces of advices like this I read online that say “read a few pages a day”. That advice is not coming from avid readers. You should not do it for the sake of doing it, or for the number of pages or books read a year. You should do it for knowledge and development.A more accurate advice is:Read every day!That’s it. Read until you understand the idea. Don’t read 20 pages because that might be half a chapter and you don’t get the idea. Don’t read 30 minutes as that might be a chapter and a half.Read one idea. One chapter if that’s doable, or just one idea that makes sense. It might be just a page, but if you get the whole picture and that’s all you can do today, that’s great. You have something to think about and process.Journal as often as you canPhoto by Jan Kahánek on UnsplashYou will notice I didn’t say every day. And tha’t because I am not talking about the classic “Dear Journal, today I did this and that”. I am talking about expressing your feelings and diving deeper into yourself.Journal when you feel like you need to. And try to clarify your thoughts:What is bothering me right now?Why am I stressed or have anxiety about?What am I feeling good about?What am I feeling grateful for right now?How I am feeling lately?The purpose is to understand you better and process feelings and emotions.Meditate every dayPhoto by Silviu Zidaru on UnsplashNow here’s a habit that I suffixed “every day” to.However, find the meditation that works best for you.The purpose if it is to be silent, slow down your mind, eliminate all the thoughts and just be. Don’t think, don’t do anything, just focus on your breath or something else.Meditation can mean different things for different people. Can be transcendental meditation, yoga, breathwork, or simply a walk. Here are a few ways that I meditate:transcendental meditationbreathworka walksit silently and eliminate any thoughtsvisualizationworkoutlisten to music and focus on ittake a showerIt doesn’t need to be hard. It just needs to slow you down, and get you inside of yourself, rather than focused on what’s happening outside.These are some of my habits, but definitely the ones that brought the most value into my life.Remember, it’s not a race. And it’s definitely not a path laid out that we all need to follow. Do what works for you, experiment. Something will stick.

9 Minimalist Habits That Will Save You Hours | by Wizdom | Feb, 2024 | MediumOpen in appSign upSign inWriteSign upSign in9 Minimalist Habits That Will Save You HoursWizdom·Follow6 min read·Feb 8, 2024--127ListenSharePhoto by Pierre Châtel-Innocenti on UnsplashMinimalism is a lifestyle choice that allows us to be more conscious of our choices and practice restraint.It’s an empowering lifestyle choice that allows us to gain control of our time and energy.By simplifying our lives, we become more efficient with our tasks and free up hours of unnecessary workload — which, in turn, helps us achieve the most out of our day so that we can spend less time stressing and more time living.Nine minimalist habits that will save you hours include:Let’s dive in!1.) Get rid of 1 thing every dayHere’s the game plan: pick one item each day that’s not pulling its weight, doesn’t spark joy, or simply doesn’t vibe with your current groove.Then, bid it farewell.Your mission, should you choose to accept it: focus on shedding just one thing every day. It’s like a daily cleanse for your belongings.Why? Because, let’s be real, most of us are drowning in a sea of “stuff” that promises comfort and value but often falls short.As you wave goodbye to these items, a magical transformation happens:Your space becomes an oasis of peace and order, unleashing a ninja-like focus and mental clarity.Suddenly, you’re mindful of what you consume, reflecting on purchases, and asking the crucial question: “Do I really need or value this in my life?”Feel like turning this into a friendly competition? Grab a buddy and make it a challenge — the first to skip a day loses.2.) Build a capsule wardrobePicture this: a concise and streamlined wardrobe selection, carefully chosen to work seamlessly together throughout the season or even the entire year.It’s all about quality over quantity, simplifying your closet and making each morning stress-free.Now, let’s talk stats. According to Marks & Spencer, the average person spends a whopping 17 minutes a day deciding what to wear. That’s four full days or six months of your life — purely dedicated to choosing an outfit.Mind-blowing, right?So, let’s dive into the capsule magic. Here’s the game plan:Decide on the number of pieces (anywhere from 25 to 50).Sort through what you have.Choose a killer colour palette.Keep those essential, versatile items.Donate what doesn’t make the cut.3.) Buy high-quality thingsLet’s talk money rules. Personally, I have 10 that I live by, and here’s Rule #3: “Buy the best and keep it as long as possible.”Believe it or not, cheap is almost always more expensive. Let me break it down.Hidden costs. Cheap products often mean lower quality, leading to frequent repairs. On the other hand, high-quality items are built to last, often with warranties and reliable customer support, reducing the need for constant fixes.Performance matters. Cheaper products might skimp on specs, causing inefficiencies in your day-to-day tasks. High-quality items? Superior performance for a smoother, more productive experience.Frequent replacement. Cheap products wear out quickly, leading to more replacements and, you guessed it, higher costs over time. High-quality items withstand wear and tear, offering longevity and fewer replacements.Customer service. Cheap products often mean inadequate support, causing frustration and wasting your precious time. Quality items come with reliable customer service from reputable companies.So, how does this apply to my 32-item wardrobe, all from the same brand? They might not be the cheapest, but with a minimal wardrobe, I’m investing in quality, comfort, and longevity.Sure, I spent more upfront, but it’s a savvy financial move in the long run. Invest wisely, and save more.4.) Unsubscribe from emailsOn average, we spend a whopping 28% of our workday tackling emails — about 120 messages a day, and we’re checking our inbox roughly 11 times per hour.That’s 88 times during a regular workday.Now, the real question: Is your inbox adding value or stealing time? Time for a closer look.For each email, ask, “Is this useful and necessary?”If the answer is ‘no,’ hit that unsubscribe button.Don’t just leave them unopened or delete them; that’s delaying the inevitable and cluttering your virtual space.Unsubscribing liberates you from the chains of useless emails, giving you more room to focus on what truly matters.So, gear up and start hitting that ‘unsubscribe’ button. Free yourself from email torture; one click at a time.5.) Streamline your financesI don’t have a magic wand regarding finances, but I do have a game-changer: automation. Instead of juggling bills like a circus performer, let’s make our money do the heavy lifting, freeing up your mental space.No, we’re not going for a completely hands-off approach; that might backfire. The idea is to shift from actively handling every penny to supervising it from a distance.Here are the keys:Automate monthly payments.Kick unused subscriptions to the curb.Set up automatic contributions to investments.Let a portion of your paycheck effortlessly glide into savings.How do we make this magic happen? Forget complex spreadsheets.Why is this important? Awareness. Before you dive into the financial playground, you need to understand the lay of the land.Once you’ve got the 411, you can automate and adjust your financial moves, such as:Consolidating bill due dates.Setting up auto-pay.Automating your budget.Full disclosure: My finances are fully automated. Set it, forget it. From bills to investments, I want to strategize, not wrestle with financial admin.6.) De-weaponize your deviceLet’s talk about our trusty sidekick, the phone — a time-devouring beast if not tamed. Ready to de-weaponize this tech giant?Here’s the battle plan:Set screen time limits: Control the monster by limiting its feasting time.Grayscale mode: Drain the allure of vibrant colours and make it less appealing.Disable non-emergency notifications: Stop the constant nagging for your attention.Add friction with apps like ‘one sec’: Make it a bit tougher to engage mindlessly.Delete time-wasting apps: If they’re not adding value, they’re gone.Organize apps into folders: Categorize them based on their purpose.Set time limits for specific apps: Be deliberate about your social media use.Utilize ‘Do Not Disturb’: Silence unnecessary notifications.Create physical distance: Keep it away when it’s not needed.Personally, I’ve set daily time limits for social media, buried them in folders, and use the ‘Do Not Disturb’ mode judiciously. Let’s make our phones work for us, not against us.7.) Prune your to-do listAs businessman Tim Collins said: “If you have more than three priorities, then you don’t have any.”Now, three might sound bare, but the essence is crucial — keep your priorities laser-focused. The more on your plate, the higher the risk of scattering your efforts.Craft a killer to-do list:Keep it short (3–6 items).Prioritize ruthlessly.Integrate it into your schedule.Need a nudge in the right direction? Enter the Ivy Lee Method. Here’s the shortened version:List your six most vital tasks for tomorrow.Prioritize them.Tackle them in order, one at a time.If some linger, roll them over to tomorrow.8.) Use the 2-Minute RuleEver heard of the 2-Minute Rule? It’s a game-changer.Here’s the golden nugget: If a task takes less than 2 minutes, do it now. Why? Because tasks have a sneaky tendency to morph into giants the longer we procrastinate.We’re in the driver’s seat today, knowing our energy levels, workload, and limitations. But, tomorrow is a wild card.Sleepless night? Emergency meeting? Surprise sickness? Life happens, and it doesn’t care about our color-coded calendars.So, tackle those quick tasks today in order to prevent tomorrow from being overrun by a cascade of small tasks.Let’s keep the pipes of productivity flowing freely, avoiding the looming tower of tiny to-dos that can overshadow the important stuff.9.) Build an idea capture systemEver wondered what the inside of our minds would look like if we could tour them, Charlie’s Chocolate Factory-style? It’s a creation factory, buzzing with problem-solving machines, creativity presses, and idea printers.But here’s the catch: our ‘mind factory’ is for having ideas, not holding them.

6 Rules That You Should Adopt In Life | by Wizdom | Medium | MediumOpen in appSign upSign inWriteSign upSign in6 Rules That You Should Adopt In LifeThese rules help to shape and guide our lives in a direction of meaning and purpose.Wizdom·Follow4 min read·Dec 23, 2023--13ListenSharePhoto by Mark Duffel on UnsplashAs a society, we need rules. Rules help to keep things in order; they keep people from harming others.Just as rules in society help to keep things in order, so do rules in our personal lives. These rules limit our wandering and responding to random stimuli and information with little or no impact on our long-term goals.There are six rules that you should adopt in life.Let’s dive in!1.) Invest heavily in yourselfThis is the key — our ticket to personal growth. Some call it ‘selfishness,’ but I see it as a personal investment.After all, we are our own best asset.Investing in ourselves isn’t just about financial returns; it’s a commitment of time and effort to become a better version of ourselves.Here’s the beauty of it: self-investment can significantly improve our lives without breaking the bank.Boosting confidence, positively impacting self-esteem, and acquiring new knowledge and skills — these are the returns on investing in oneself.Ways to invest in you:Explore Interests:Take a course, watch documentaries, or listen to a podcast.Dive into books that stretch your mind.Google your interests and let the discovery begin.Acquire Skills:Develop social, communication, and interpersonal skills.Consider formal training or workshops.Prioritize Health:Invest in healthier food choices.Join a gym or work with a personal trainer.Start a Side Hustle:Supplement your income to pay off debts or save for the future.Aim for financial independence and freedom.Remember, the possibilities are vast. The critical part is understanding where you want to improve, why, and the direction that makes the most sense for you.It all begins with the belief that you deserve this investment in yourself.Time to grow and thrive!2.) See yourself as a brandWe must see ourselves as a brand worthy of an excellent reputation, aiming for the respect enjoyed by iconic brands like Mercedes-Benz.But how do we earn this respect?Create Confidence, Not Doubt:Confidence is the key to performing our best under stress.Breed confidence by facing daily fears, maintaining the right mindset, reflecting on memories, and adjusting internal messaging.Project confidence without arrogance, setting an example for others.Know When to Speak:Silence attracts respect; it’s powerful and improves relations.Actions speak louder than words, and listening provides valuable knowledge.Use silence strategically, be comfortable with it, and avoid unnecessary noise.Speak only when it enhances silence.Endure Criticism:Criticism’s power lies in our reaction to it.Endure criticism without losing composure; it’s an opportunity for growth.Daily decisions: Let criticism outweigh the desire for success or let success overshadow the dents of criticism.Avoid Drama:Drama evaporates reputation; steer clear of it at all costs.Refuse gossip, winning trust and respect by being someone who rises above drama.In embracing these principles, we position ourselves as individuals deserving of admiration, fostering trust and respect from those around us.3.) At the end of each year, evaluateAudits guide us in pinpointing areas for improvement and assessing our life’s trajectory. Let’s delve into key areas:Health:Are we dedicating time to mental and physical well-being?Long-term success requires sustained effort.Reflect on physical care routines — exercise, stretching, meditation.Address emotions productively rather than burying them.Finances:Does financial standing align with happiness?Understand spending habits and identify potential investments.Avoid distractions; focus on proven financial strategies.Personal Development:Evaluate current skills and identify desired ones.Explore methods for acquiring new skills and clarify their importance.Relationships:Assess your social circle and its impact.Reflect on how time spent with certain individuals influences your feelings.Rate your overall relationship with yourself and understand why.Self-Care:Do we prioritize self-care?Identify activities that bring joy and assess if they’re part of your routine.Recognize obstacles preventing self-care.Home Life:Gauge quality time spent at home.Ensure presentness and establish boundaries between personal and professional life.Address factors hindering goal pursuit, such as excessive TV consumption.Bonus Questions:What changes would make the most significant impact on your life?The key is non-judgmental recognition, summarization, and identifying opportunities.Goal Setting:Categorize goals into health, finances, personal development, relationships, self-care, and home life.Ensure continual progress across all aspects of life.This process is not about judgment but about self-awareness, summarizing findings, and identifying growth opportunities.Thank you for reading.The next blog post will cover the remaining three rules.LifeRulesInvestingHealthSide Hustle----13FollowWritten by Wizdom6.2K FollowersWizdom is a self-growth app. We are amongst the Top 10 Educational Apps in India. https://wizdomapp.com/FollowHelpStatusAboutCareersBlogPrivacyTermsText to speechTeams 
5 Things You’re Doing Wrong in the Morning | by Wizdom | Mar, 2024 | MediumOpen in appSign upSign inWriteSign upSign in5 Things You’re Doing Wrong in the MorningWizdom·Follow5 min read·Mar 18, 2024--5ListenSharePhoto by dominik hofbauer on UnsplashJust the thought of the morning is enough to make many people cringe.From the moment we wake up, our mind begins to fill with information and tasks.This overwhelming feeling can give mornings a bad name, and these times often set the mood for the rest of our day. Our choices during the first hour or so of our morning usually determine what the rest of our day will look like.The five things you’re doing wrong in the morning include:Let’s dive in!1.) Allowing yourself to feel overwhelmedHave you ever had that moment where you hit the pillow, blink, and suddenly it’s morning — complete with a to-do list longer than a CVS receipt?Yeah, we’ve all been there.But what if I told you there’s a way to tame that mental tornado?Enter: the power of a straightforward question.Instead of drowning in a sea of tasks, you start your day by asking yourself, “What’s the one thing I’m committed to completing today?” (Genius, right?)Focusing on just one thing helps declutter your mind, prioritize like a pro, and streamline your workload. It’s as easy as brushing your teeth (literally).Jot down that magic question, slap it on your bathroom mirror, and voila — instant clarity booster.As you go about your morning routine, ask yourself and commit to making that one thing your top priority for the day.Remember: when everything’s a priority, nothing is.So, let’s simplify, prioritize, and conquer the day, one focused step at a time.2.) Skipping breakfastWe all know breakfast is supposed to be the MVP of meals — but let’s be honest, who’s got time for that in the morning rush?I’ve been guilty of hitting the snooze button and skipping it, too. However, there’s a way to whip up a power-packed breakfast in just five minutes in order to fuel your day like a boss.Breakfast isn’t just about filling your belly; it’s about kickstarting your entire system. And if you pick something tasty and healthy, chances are you’ll actually stick to the habit.So, what’s on the menu?How about a refreshing smoothie packed with fresh fruit, yogurt, almond milk, and a sprinkle of cinnamon?Or… maybe some Greek yogurt topped with crunchy granola?And let’s not forget the classic bowl of Honey Bunches of Oats — simple, delicious, and satisfying.Don’t forget to load up on the fresh fruit. Strawberries, bananas, coconut — the options are endless.Bonus: toss in some walnuts and almonds for an extra brain boost. Trust me, your mind will thank you later.See, walnuts are like the superheroes of nuts, packed with brain-boosting DHA. And almonds? They’re loaded with vitamin E, which some researchers say could help keep your brain sharp as a tack.When you fuel your body and your brain, there’s no telling what you can conquer.3.) Wasting the morning on unimportant things80% of us are guilty of checking our phones within the first 10 minutes of waking up.But let me tell you, scrolling through Instagram or Twitter before your eyes even adjust to the light?Not exactly a mood booster.Sure, staying up-to-date on world events seems productive, but trust me, it’s a one-way ticket to distraction city.By letting those notifications flood our brains first thing in the morning, we’re basically inviting chaos to crash the party.Here’s a radical idea: what if we saved social media and news updates for later in the day?Imagine starting your morning with a clean slate, free from the noise of notifications and opinions…Step one: turn off those pesky notifications. (Seriously, you don’t need to be “on” 24/7.)Step two: limit your email and social media checks to 2–3 times daily. Trust me, your sanity will thank you.Schedule it in your calendar and set a timer — because nobody has time to get lost in the scroll. And while we’re at it, let’s declutter our digital space too.Close those browser tabs and create a distraction-free zone on your desktop. Because just like clearing physical clutter, clearing mental clutter is a game-changer.4.) Not focusing on the important stuffAh, the timeless struggle of estimating time — we’ve all been there.Diving headfirst into work might seem like the ultimate productivity hack, but it could actually be doing more harm than good in the long run.That’s where the power of deep work comes in. Picture this: focused, uninterrupted, analytical thinking that puts you in the zone. Yeah, that’s the good stuff.So, what does deep work look like? Think reading, writing, coding, problem-solving — basically anything that requires you to dive deep into the task at hand.Here’s the science bit: our brains hit peak performance 2–4 hours after waking up.Translation?Morning is prime time for deep work. By tapping into our body’s biological clock, we can easily tackle complex problems and think more deeply.Knocking out that challenging cognitive work early means you’ll feel like a rockstar for the rest of the day.5.) Not being selective about how to feed your brainEver feel like you’re just reacting to the chaos of the world around you? Emails, texts, projects — it’s like we’re spectators in our lives, right?But what if we intentionally listened to ourselves instead of drowning in external noise?This could be like starting your day with a mindful meditation or diving into a podcast on a topic that interests you.If you’re strapped for time, consider setting your alarm 30 minutes earlier to catch quality reading time.Trust me, a chapter or two can work wonders for your mental health and productivity.Now, let’s be honest — mornings aren’t always smooth sailing. But by being mindful of our habits and making intentional choices, we can transform our mornings into a powerhouse of mental clarity, productivity, and success.ConclusionThere you have it — 5 things you’re doing wrong in the morning. I hope the examples and definitions in this guide help you transform your mornings into a powerful launching pad for success.Thank you for reading!MorningMorning RoutinesHappinessPeacePodcast----5FollowWritten by Wizdom6.2K FollowersWizdom is a self-growth app. We are amongst the Top 10 Educational Apps in India. https://wizdomapp.com/FollowHelpStatusAboutCareersBlogPrivacyTermsText to speechTeams 
How I Tricked My Brain To Like Doing Hard Things [Dopamine Detox] | by Vinuki Vidhara | SoulSync | MediumOpen in appSign upSign inWriteSign upSign inMastodonHow I Tricked My Brain To Like Doing Hard Things [Dopamine Detox]Why are some people more motivated to tackle difficult things? And is there a way to make doing difficult things, easy?Vinuki Vidhara·FollowPublished inSoulSync·9 min read·Jan 26, 2024--32ListenShareYou probably have no problem playing your daily scheduled video games or browsing social media. There is also no doubt that you can sit in front of the screen and stare at it all day without a break in concentration.Photo by Georgia de Lotz on UnsplashBut think about studying for 1 hour…OOFF!! That might be hard. Or even working on your side business for 1 hour…Hmm. Doesn’t sound so appealing.Ah, you’re probably scratching your head, wondering, “Is she a modern-day witch, or did she just binge-watch too many mind-reading tutorials on the mystical internet? Is there a Hogwarts for telepaths I don’t know about.Well…that’s not the case. Or…maybe it is 😉Okay, realistically speaking, no doubt studying, exercising, building a business or something equally productive would bring more benefits in the long run. But knowing this, we still prefer watching TV, playing video games and browsing social media. [Yeah…I do the same too…Guilty as charged]However, one might argue that it’s obvious why this happens. It’s the simple reason that one activity is easy and doesn’t require much effort, whereas the other is difficult and requires you to apply yourself.Photo by Michał Parzuchowski on UnsplashBUT some people don’t mind studying, exercising, or working on side projects regularly. [Wait….let’s rewind…what?…they are people who actually like these…]Saying some people enjoy doing these activities begs the question: Why are some motivated to tackle difficult things? Is there a method to make difficult things easy? Well…I know you also want to know the secret behind this, so let’s dive right into it.To answer this question, we need to look at the brain neurotransmitter, Dopamine. Dopamine is often considered the pleasure molecule. But, what that is, is not what it does. What exactly does dopamine do? — It makes us desire things.Photo by Dmitry Shamis on UnsplashThis desire gives motivation to get up and do stuff. However, we are still not sure as to how powerful dopamine is. But let me note down a few experiments that neuroscientists did on rats.Researchers planted electrodes on the brains of rats and there was a lever which was placed in front of them. Whenever the rat pulled the lever, the researchers stimulated the rat’s reward system, ultimately making the rats develop a craving so strong that they pulled the lever over and over again for hours. The rats refused to eat or sleep, and they kept pressing the lever until they dropped from exhaustion.BUT THEN THE PROCESS WAS REVERSED. The researchers blocked the release of dopamine in the rat’s reward system. They became so lethargic that they didn’t even put the effort to get up and drink some water. They didn’t eat, didn’t want to mate, or didn’t crave anything at all. What was seen is that the rats lost their will to live. When food was placed close to their mouths, they would happily enjoy it but didn’t have the motivation to do it themselves.You would think thirst and hunger motivate us to eat and drink but dopamine plays a key role here. These rat experiments are extreme cases, but you can see the similar effects dopamine has in humans and our daily lives.Photo by Mehdi Sepehri on UnsplashIn fact, your brain develops priorities in large part because of how much dopamine it is expected to get.If that particular activity releases too little dopamine, there will be less motivation to do it. But if it releases a lot of dopamine, you will be motivated to repeat it over and over again.So what behaviours release dopamine? — Any activity you anticipate a particular reward, releases it. If no immediate rewards are there, then the brain won’t release it.— For example, before eating comfort food, the brain releases dopamine because you anticipate the food will make you feel good.Your brain doesn’t care if high dopamine levels are damaging, it just wants more. Ex: A drug addict knows what he’s doing is not good for him, but still he wants more. Besides, getting high on cocaine and heroin releases unwanted amounts of dopamine.Simply speaking, nearly everything releases dopamineThe highest dopamine is released when you get a reward randomly. Well…isn’t that obvious…If you are playing on a slot machine, even if you lose, you expect a bigger reward. You just don’t know when it will happen.Photo by Alex Haney on UnsplashIn today’s digital world, we are flooding our brains with unnecessary amounts of dopamine daily, even if we don’t know this. May it be scrolling through social media or playing video games. We anticipate some reward with such behaviours.— That’s why we are constantly checking our phones, expecting a text message or notification and that we are eventually getting it. (We are trying to get that dopamine hit like those rats). Now, you’ll be like…”OH, SO WHAT, it wouldn’t harm me anyway.” But you are wrong…Our bodies have various biological systems, one namely called “homeostasis.” Homeostasis means our body likes to keep its internal chemical and physical conditions at a balanced level. Whenever an imbalance happens, the body adapts.— For example, if the environment is cold, your body temperature goes down, so you shiver to generate heat and warm up your body. Similarly, if it’s hot outside, your body temperature goes up, so you start sweating to lose that heat. Your body tries to be at 37 degrees Celsius at all times, no matter what.Photo by Manki Kim on UnsplashHomeostasis has another way to manifest itself, and this is called tolerance. For example, someone who rarely drinks will get drunk fast, whereas someone who drinks regularly will have to drink more because they have developed a tolerance towards alcohol, thereby making them less sensitive to its effects.IT’S NOT SO MUCH DIFFERENT WITH DOPAMINE. Your body tries to maintain homeostasis, so down-regulates your dopamine levels. Essentially your body gets used to having high dopamine levels and now it becomes your new normal, so you develop dopamine tolerance.This is a huge problem because the activities that don’t give you much dopamine don’t interest you any longer, so you don’t feel motivated to do them. You feel bored, and less fun as it doesn’t release much dopamine. That’s why we like to play video games and browse social media rather than study or work. Video games make us feel free, good and comfortable as they release a good amount of dopamine than what is released when studying or working.This is why drug addicts find it difficult to have a normal life. They take drugs, and their dopamine tolerance gets so high, that their normal life isn’t able to match it. They become like the rats from those previous experiments who have no motivation to do anything. It’s like when we experience the effects of high dopamine, we simply aren’t able to enjoy low dopamine behaviours.Photo by Tony Tran on UnsplashNow this begs the question…Is there anything that can be done to prevent this? The answer is to perform a dopamine detox.— What you are going to do is → set aside a day where you are going to avoid all highly stimulating activities. You are going to stop flooding your brain with high amounts of dopamine and you are going to make your dopamine receptors recover.For one whole day, you are going to have little fun with no internet, no technology like your phone or computer, listen to music or eat junk food. You are going to remove all sources of external pleasure for the entire day. You are going to embrace boredom. And trust me…there’ll be a lot of boredom. You are however, allowed to do the following → go for a walk, meditate and be alone with your thoughts, reflect on life and goals, and write down any ideas you get on a physical piece of paper.These all might seem intense, but if you want radical results, you want them fast, you need to be able to take radical action.You must be asking yourself, why would this work?— Let’s say, you have been eating every single day at the best restaurant in your town. So, those fancy meals become your new normal. If you are offered a bowl of rice, you would probably refuse, as it isn’t like your fancy restaurant meal.— But if you are stranded on an island, and if you are starving, then that bowl of rice wouldn’t seem so bad.That’s what the dopamine detox does. It starves you all the pleasure you usually get, and in turn, makes those activities more desirable. To put it simply, dopamine detox works because you feel bored making those boring stuff more fun.Photo by Priscilla Du Preez 🇨🇦 on UnsplashNow if you don’t want any extreme pressure or if you do not want to starve yourself of all the pleasure, you can perform a smaller dopamine detox.— Pick one day of the week and you are going to refrain from doing one of your high dopamine behaviours completely. You can do all other things, but the behaviour you choose is off-limits.You will become slightly bored but that’s the point. Let your dopamine receptors recover from the high dopamine. So boredom is going to propel you to another task, one that you feel like not doing usually. Since you are bored, it’ll be easier for you to do them.Avoiding high dopamine behaviours once in a while is good, but ideally, you should avoid all these behaviours altogether, or as much as possible.Instead, you can add more dopamine to the activities that benefit you, making you pursue those regularly, and giving you long-term benefits. You can do this by using one of your high-dopamine-releasing activities as a reward after completing difficult work.Photo by Kenny Eliason on UnsplashTrack all low dopamine activities, like cleaning, studying or exercising. After doing these to some extent, I reward myself with the same amount of high-dopamine activity at the end of the day. Notice the keywords here; “After” and “at the end of the day.”If I indulge in high-dopamine activities first, then I’m not going to feel like doing the low-dopamine ones. I will not be motivated enough. So low-dopamine first….then high-dopamine…— For example, for one hour of completed low-dopamine work, I reward myself with 15 min of high-dopamine behaviour at the end of the day. That means for 8 hours of low dopamine, I allow myself around 2 hours of dopamine. Of course, these are my ratios, you can tweak them to your liking….NOTE: If your high-dopamine activity is addictive like smoking or drinking, then you shouldn’t treat it as a reward. Instead, find a different one that is not damaging.If you are wondering what my guilty pleasure is, it’s the internet. I get lost there and lose track of time. That’s why I have this system, so I’m able to control my addiction. But I still have some days where I refrain from engaging in any high dopamine activities completely.I can definitely tell you that it’s worth it….So if you have no motivation, start dopamine detoxing your brain ASAP!!! — Separate yourself from the unhealthy amounts of dopamine released. Only then those normal and everyday behaviours will be exciting and you’ll be able to do them longer.We are all dopamine addicts to some extent. And that’s a good thing because dopamine motivates us to achieve our goals and improve ourselves.But it’s for you to decide where you’re going to get it.THE CHOICE IS YOURS!!!Thank you for reading this post!! 💜Leave 👏 or ✍️ if you like it.Consider following me on Medium AND my publication “SoulSync”Buy me a coffee: https://ko-fi.com/vinukividharaThank you!!Do you have any questions or suggestions or want to collaborate with me?Message me:vinukividharaubeysinghe@gmail.comInstagramTwitterLinkedinSoulsyncMotivationLife LessonsDopamine DetoxFeatured----32FollowWritten by Vinuki Vidhara721 Followers·Editor for SoulSync💊🔬Obsessed✍️Writer on Medium📢 Articles about Science, Health, Wellness & Productivity.

But, you need to learn how to use this tool. This blog will show you how to use ChatGPT in daily life with different scenarios. You can use ChatGPT for free. But, if you pay $20 a month, you can use this chatbot faster and based on GPT-4.Good, we briefly reviewed what ChatGPT is. Now, let’s look at the usage scenarios.1. SummarizingNew books come out every day in areas such as finance, motivation, and programming, right? Let’s be real, we don’t have time to read most of these books. This is where ChatGPT comes into play.To show this, let’s ask ChatGPT to summarize the animal farm book by George Orwell. Let’s say,Summarize animal farm by George Orwell.As you can see, ChatGPT is writing us a summary of the book. Of course, it’s better to read the whole book. But if you don’t have the time, this is one way to get an idea of the book. Thus, by looking at this summary, you can decide whether to spend time on the book.Ok, we’ve seen how ChatGPT summarizes a book. Let’s move on to how to find the best products using ChatGPT.2. RecommendationWe always want to find the best quality products and read the best books. We often read reviews and watch videos to find the best ones. But this process is very tiring and takes a lot of time, right? Don’t worry, ChatGPT helps you find the best products.Let’s say, you want to specialize in data science. You want to find the best books for this. Just ask this to ChatGPT. Hey ChatGPT,Recommend 5 best books on data science.As you can see, ChatGPT started recommending books within seconds. It is writing not only the names of the books but also the features of the books.It’s great, right? In this way, you can get holiday, movie, and computer recommendations from ChatGPT.Ok, we saw how to get recommendations to find the best product using ChatGPT. Let’s go ahead and see how we can use ChatGPT for marketing.3. MarketingWe all have expertise in different areas. For example, I like to deal with data science, AI, and programming. But, we can’t be experts in every field, can we?For example, let’s consider a web developer. This person may well be an expert in web development and design. On the one hand, he or she needs to advertise himself to get a job, or he or she needs to pay agencies for advertising.The good news is that ChatGPT can be your lifesaver to avoid spending money. This model is definitely a game changer for making money.For example, you want to create a Facebook ad. Hey ChatGPT,Create a Facebook ad for the best web development agency.Bammm. As you can see, it first wrote the title and then gave us the necessary texts.This’s amazing. You no longer need to search for an agency for an advertisement. ChatGPT did this for you in seconds.I have good news. ChatGPT is not just limited to advertising. From e-mail campaigns to social media posts, you can have this model do all your marketing content. So you can save both time and money.Ok, we’ve seen how to use ChtGPT in marketing. Let’s go ahead and see how to use this tool for content creation.4. Creating ContentCreating content has become one of the most important skills today. By creating content, you can both improve yourself and create a wide network.It’s important to find interesting titles for your content. When you make a youtube video or write a blog post, you should find a catchy title. To do this, you can use ChatGPT.Let’s say, you want to create an AI-supported education platform. You want to find an interesting title for this startup idea. You can use ChatGPT for this. Hey ChatGPT,I want to build an AI-powered education platform. Suggest 10 catchy names for this startup idea.As you can see, it started to write 10 names. You can use one of these names for your startup. Awesome, if you want, you can also create catchy titles for your blog post or for your youtube channel in this way.Ok, we’ve seen how to use ChatGPT to create content. Now let’s look at how to use this model to learn real-life stories.5 . Personal DevelopmentI love reading real-life stories for inspiration. But let’s be real, reading long life stories can be daunting at times. This is where ChatGPT comes into play. This tool is pretty talented when you want to see a summary of the real stories of successful people.For example, you want to learn about the life of Steve Jobs for inspiration. You can get help from ChatGPT for this. Let’s ask, hey ChatGPT,Tell me the true story of Steve Jobs, the Apple founder to motivate me.The life story of Steve Jobs is an inspiration to many. He founded a company at the age of 19 and developed the first Apple computer with Steve Wozniak.He is then fired from the company he founded. At this point, many thought your career was over.However, Jobs founded another computer company called NeXT and bought an animation studio called Pixar. The acquisition of Pixar by Disney was a huge success for him.After these successes, he returned to Apple as the CEO, which he founded, and was fired. And provided the development of innovative products such as the iPod, iPhone, and iPad.This way, you can learn about the life stories of successful people like Bill Gates and be inspired by their stories.Ok, in this section, we looked at how to use ChatGPT for personal development. Let’s go ahead and take a look at how ChatGPT simplifies complex matters.6. Simplifying Complex IssuesWe often encountered complex, difficult-to-understand problems. Sometimes understanding these issues is a big challenge. It would be great if someone could explain complex concepts by simplifying them, right?I have great news for you. ChatGPT simplifies everything for you. Whether you’re a programmer, marketer, or just a curious student, ChatGPT makes the most complex topics easy for you to understand.For example, let’s ask ChatGPT to explain quantum computing to us simply. Hey ChatGPT,Explain quantum computing like I'm 5.Bammm. As you can see, it simplified a complex subject like quantum computing and gave simple examples when explaining.You can get an idea of this complex subject by reading this text. Whether you want to learn the latest complex technological topics or grasp complex academic terms, ChatGPT is at your service. Ask this tool to simplify difficult topics, sit back and just read the magic words.Ok, you’ve seen how ChatGPT makes complex topics understandable.

Don’t worry, many people feel the same way.Unless you live in a native English-speaking country, it will be difficult for you to learn grammar rules and everyday expressions. But, fear not, ChatGPT will help you improve your language skills in seconds.Let’s say, you want to receive payment from a company. Write your sentences first and then turn them into more formal sentences with ChatGPT. Let me show you this. Hey ChatGPT,Rewrite this sentence more formally: "I want to receive payment. Can you send the invoice"As you can see, it wrote this sentence in a more formal way in seconds. You can also use ChatGPT for purposes such as correcting grammar errors, improving text fluency, or translating content.Okay, you’ve seen how you can use this tool for language. Let’s finally take a look at how to use ChatGPT to get a job.8. Preparing for interviewsIt’s hard to show your potential in interviews. You wish to showcase your knowledge and skills, but at the same time, HR tries to give you the lowest possible salary.You can ask ChatGPT for the best tips and tricks to succeed in interviews. Let’s demonstrate this with an example. Let’s say, hey ChatGPT,Act as an interviewer and ask me 10 difficult questions as a data scientist.As you can see, ChatGPT started writing the questions. By studying these questions, you can answer questions asked in the interview like an expert.But wait, that’s not all. ChatGPT also helps you negotiate a better salary. Let’s say, hey ChatGPT,How do I respond if the interviewer asks me for a salary?Interviews are essentially a tactical struggle. By applying these strategies, you can receive a salary from your employer commensurate with your skills.Wrap-UpThe new trend today is to use AI tools.

Reading Books Is Useless: Here’s a Better Way to Read | by Kevin Nokia | MediumOpen in appSign upSign inWriteSign upSign inReading Books Is Useless: Here’s a Better Way to ReadKevin Nokia·Follow5 min read·Jan 28, 2024--223ListenSharePhoto by Thought Catalog on UnsplashI love to read books.I always spend some time just sitting down and reading; it doesn’t matter how many pages I read or how long. I just stay still and read. When I really can’t use paper books, I use ebooks as an alternative.Wherever I read, especially in a cafe, it really helps me become focused and understand more about what I read. It’s just that the environment is pretty important for me to read and do some work. This is a little bit of a recommendation for you if you aren’t getting enough focus to read or study.Find a place where you can become as productive as you are.It could be:CafeLibraryHotel roomEtc.The environment is important for reading and doing your work, whether it’s writing or studying.Reading doesn’t workEven so, reading doesn’t change anything in me.The more I read, the more I realize that I didn’t change anything. I am still the same person I was before, and reading is just some kind of procrastination for what I have to do. It’s like a delusion that I have made progress when I've actually not.Reading is useless.I love that people share information about how to read more, how to effectively read books, and how to read hard books. I wrote some articles about that, too.I’m one of them.Most people just read:When they want to go to sleep.When they are waiting for someone else.When they don’t know what to do.When they want to stop playing social media and want to be productive.Even so, why did we want to read?We all want to be smart.We all want to expand our knowledge.We all want to be able to read many books in a year.Even so, it doesn’t change a thing if we just read the book.This is why I switch from reading books to studying books.Studying booksI learned this from Alex Hormozi in his Youtube shorts, where he doesn’t read anymore but studies books.It is actually important because most people just read them and do not really plant the knowledge they understand in their minds. They just randomly read it without studying it.The important step is studying it and applying it.You can read five self-improvement books, apply them 100%, and you’ll be better than most of the readers.Important keyThe key to reading books is not just reading them and telling people how many pages you read.It’s about how much you understand and apply it in your life. You don’t have to apply everything from what you read, but there’s something that you can learn and apply to become a better human being, right?The key is not entirely about the book, but how you study it and apply it to your everyday life.So, here’s how I study books rather than read them.1. I don’t let myself love my book too much.I stop loving my books too much because if I love them too much,I will guard them,clean them, andavoid writing important notes and ideas in the book.I know that you can write it on a piece of paper or in a notebook, but sometimes I want to re-read it.If I’m trying to find my notes in my notebook, it’s going to take me some time and energy to find my book, rather than seeing the notes in the book that I read. So I avoid that by just making a tick or line on great paragraphs or sentences.That helped me to focus on the marked sentences and really pay more attention to them.This works for quick notes, but if you want to make a summary, of course you will need a notebook or a piece of paper to write it down.2. Write it down, highlight it, and repeat it until it sticks in your mind.It’s just like a common study method.You write something down, and you read it over and over again. You try to explain it in your own words on your notes and repeat it. This way, you will understand more and understand how you can implement it in your own way.The more you understand, the more you stick with the book.3. Re-read the same book that you want to apply to.I read Atomic Habits by James Clear more than once.It’s because I want to apply it. You can do this too for the books that you want to apply in your life. You don’t have to apply to every book that you have.If you find something useful, write it down.Sometimes there are books that explain just one concept but make it into a one book. So for a book like this, you only need to write down a single idea or summary, so you don’t have to re-read the whole book.But if the book includes a lot of ideas and implementation, I suggest you re-read it and make an ultimate summary of it.The purpose of studying books doesn’t really mean that reading is wrong.It’s just a method that’s much more effective than just reading with your eyes and hoping you can change your life.So, it is important for us to understand that it’s not wrong with reading; it is just not effective if we want to implement it in our lives.I hope it helped, and don’t stop learning!“Reading is to The Mind as Exercise is to The Body.”— Brian TracyReading without implementation is useless.As well as using our eyes to “read” the words from the book we are reading without understanding them.This is why I made a free template for you. I hope you can use it as an easy way to study books with implementation guides.You can download it from the link here: Let’s start studying!More articles about reading:Humans Are Much Better at Reading on Paper Than on a Screen!10 Tips On How To Understand What You ReadHow To Improve Your ReadingHow To Finish The Book You BoughtWhy Reading Is Part of SuccessAbout meTwitter: @ItsKevinNokiaInstagram: @kevinnokia_writingFREE Changing-Life Blueprint: Click hereHey!

Take a Break from Worrying About What You Can’t Control | by Kevin Nokia | Mar, 2024 | MediumOpen in appSign upSign inWriteSign upSign inTake a Break from Worrying About What You Can’t ControlLearn how to deal with worrying and make the most of where you are in your work and decision-making.Kevin Nokia·Follow5 min read·Mar 14, 2024--12ListenShareThe Movie “Passengers”We can’t live with worrying too much.Worrying actually leads us to fear, and fear leads us to bad decisions and avoiding what we need to do. Worrying, on the other hand, could lead you to unhappiness and resentment toward other people because you are relying on what you think. This is what we call overthinking.If we can deal with worrying and take action right away, we will be able to overcome the fear and obstacles that we face. We can achieve what we want in life and become the best version of ourselves when making decisions and working.So, to deal with worrying, you need to know certain things about why we worry too much to deal with the roots or the cause, which could lead us to disaster.You are worrying because you don’t know what the end is.We all wanted to know what would happen at the ending scene.At least we have some certainty that everything will go according to our plan. However, we tried to plan too much and then try to control what the end looked like.You didn’t know that, in the end, people could react differently to what you planned. You visualize, but still, there is no sign of what the end will be.This ended up being something we called anxiety and overthinking.You are worried because you are not sure where you’ll be in the future.You know what you want in the future, but is it really going to be that way?You know what you plan for the future, but is it really going to be that way?You know what you envision for the future, but is it really going to be that way?Too much of this thinking actually leads to more worrying and anxiety. We became overthinking once again and didn’t really think straight about what the present moment is.We end up living in the future and forgetting the most about where we are right now.You are worrying because you don’t know what to do.Some disasters could happen at any time.Your job might be frustrating right now.Your business might not be making a profit right now.Your family might not be in their happiest moment right now.Even so, we are still figuring out what to do instead of saying yes to what has already happened.Not knowing what to do and being frustrated to figure it out actually ends up being worrying.Sometimes we can only let it happen today and focus on what we usually do. This is where you are trained to be more forgiving, let go of the things that have already been done, and just let them be.You are worrying too much about “What should I do now?” instead of really seeing the situation and just saying yes to it for a moment. I don’t ask you to just let it go if the world goes down, but at least take a moment to see the world or situation you are in right now.After you are in a peaceful state, you will know what you need to do rather than what you ‘want’ to do.You are worrying because you are not in the “right” place.You think that you are supposed to be somewhere else.You think that you are supposed to be rich right now.You think that you are working in the wrong place.You think that you are in the wrong environment.Where you are right now is actually part of progressing toward becoming someone better. You are set up in a certain place for a reason. God, always give us something that we don’t expect but that we actually need.Our own eyes can’t see it, but God knows what is right for you and what is not.This is why we end up controlling what we can’t control.We are human beings who can’t see the future or even go back to the past.We just live in this world, rented, in a world where it is not us who built it. Still, we are arrogantly trying to control what we can’t control and worrying about something that is not necessary to think of.This is where worrying ends up compounding and becoming depressing.Take a break from worrying about what you can’t control and live a little.Yes, you are right; we are not in the “right” place sometimes.Maybe we are not in the best situation right now, but does it really matter to think about that all the time and worry too much?We live to live, not to think all the time.“A person who thinks all the time has nothing to think about except thoughts. So, he loses touch with reality and lives in a world of illusions.”― Alan WattsThe more you are in touch with reality and just ‘live a little’ in your life, you will know that you are doing fine.You might still be worrying about where you are right now rather than actually doing the thing you need to do.So, separate what you can control and what you can’t control. Let it be on what you can’t control and focus on what you can control, which is doing the thing.You are here to become better for God, you, your family, and the people in this world. You are born to become something that God created you to be.Are you willing to become the ultimate version of yourself that God has set for you?“…the point is, you can’t get so hung up on where you’d rather be that you forget to make the most of where you are.Take a break from worrying about what you can’t control.Live a little.”— From the movie ‘Passengers’About MeTwitter: @ItsKevinNokiaInstagram: @Kevin_nokiaFREE Changing-Life Blueprint: Click hereFREE My Booknotes Template Out NOW: Grab one!Hey!
