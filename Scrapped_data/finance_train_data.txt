Read MoreExpertiseFP&AFinancial ModelingFinancial ForecastingPrevious RoleDirector of Strategic FP&APREVIOUSLY ATShareShare All management teams want to position their company to weather the ups and downs of a business cycle without compromising its ability to thrive. The key to that goal is optimizing profit targets. While all organizations generally apply some effort to profit optimization initiatives, I’ve found that when those attempts fall short, it’s because they lack a strong framework for establishing the right targets or a strategy for executing on their goals. Establishing this kind of framework is all the more important when economic trends are gloomy. A potential recession can cast doubt on expected revenue growth and cash flows. Inflationary pressures push wages, material costs, and operating expenses upward, eroding profitability unless they’re swiftly countered with price increases or other offsetting levers. Higher interest rates tighten the screws further, negatively impacting return on invested capital, especially for businesses with unhedged floating-rate debt obligations. That doesn’t mean it’s time to panic. Challenging times present an opportunity for leadership to head off financial distress by reviewing company processes, vendor agreements, product portfolios, pricing, and other factors to streamline operations and craft strategies that deliver optimal margins while enabling the business to achieve key objectives. Having resources allocated as efficiently as possible allows management to move quickly and confidently in the face of headwinds. And if a recession doesn’t materialize, or other trends improve, your company will be more advantageously positioned to capitalize on new growth investments. In this article, I outline a four-step strategic process businesses can use to successfully define and implement profitability optimization initiatives in the face of steep inflation and high interest rates. I focus on EBITDA margins in order to eliminate the noncash impact of depreciation and amortization, which are less directly impacted by profitability initiatives. Step 1: Define Optimal Profitability and Establish Targets As Yogi Berra famously said, “You’ve got to be very careful if you don’t know where you are going because you might not get there.” Once you untangle this advice, it applies to all strategic planning. When dealing with profit optimization, it’s critical that management doesn’t engage in initiatives that deliver short-term improvements at the expense of long-term strategic objectives. Frequently, I’ll see management teams set goals without knowing the true potential of their business. Traditionally, you’d analyze your historical data in order to estimate future profitability targets—however, that can shortchange your organization. In isolation, historical data can’t tell you everything about your business capabilities, especially as circumstances change, or whether your company’s previous performance is sustainable in the long term. If you only look at what you’ve done before, you could set a target that falls well short of—or worse, in excess of—what you can actually attain. For example, a company’s management may see that the business averaged an EBITDA margin of 13% over the past three years. Partially due to external factors, margins have decreased to 9% this year. By establishing goals only on the basis of the historical data, management establishes the initiative of restoring EBITDA margins to 13%. While this approach may work to sustain the business, allow you to achieve prior profitability levels, or even reach new levels of profitability, it doesn’t define the true potential for EBITDA margins. Opportunities to achieve 15% or 17% margins might exist, but the company will never reach them if its leaders don’t understand what’s possible. Over time, these percentage points will become worth millions of dollars to stakeholders. Let’s examine what you should do instead of relying solely on historical data. Looking at the example below, we can see that the (creatively named) ABC Co.—a hypothetical HR and payroll software company—is currently enjoying an EBITDA margin of 15% with a historical five-year average of 13.5%. But ABC Co.’s leadership should not assume it can rest on its laurels. ABC Co. Company Margins (USD in thousands) 5-Year Averages20232022202120202019ABC Co.Entire Industry Companies of Similar Size Revenue$20,530$18,888$17,377$15,986$14,708Gross Profit$13,837$11,937$10,200$9,592$8,207Operating Expenses($10,963)($9,387)($8,011)($7,833)($6,604)Operating Income$2,874$2,550$2,189$1,759$1,603D&A$205$189$174$160$147EBITDA$3,080$2,739$2,363$1,918$1,750Gross Profit Margin67.4%63.2%58.7%60.0%55.8%61.5%77.3%66.3%Operating Margin14.0%13.5%12.6%11.0%10.9%12.5%14.9%13.4%EBITDA Margin15.0%14.5%13.6%12.0%11.9%13.5%16.5%15.0% By pulling individual company data for competitors and performing additional industry and market research, it’s possible to establish industry average EBITDA margins, as well as margins for similarly sized companies. This data is readily available for public companies; for private companies, you may only be able to obtain it through a paid service like D&B Hoovers, IBISWorld, or Pitchbook. If your business is having difficulty accessing this information or finding quality data, a good finance and strategy consultant will be able to help provide benchmarking data and to conduct a thorough analysis with actionable conclusions. In the case of ABC Co., we’ll establish that its best-in-class EBITDA margins for its industry are in the 28% range, per IBISWorld research. At this point, ABC Co. can establish a few benchmarking scenarios for what its own optimal EBITDA margin could be—best in class, high performer, industry average, or comparable to an average similarly sized company. With this information in hand, management can then begin evaluating performance against these benchmarks to establish which one might be attainable. Let’s assume ABC Co. management has established the following benchmarks to measure the company against, and set these associated targets. These benchmarks compare ABC Co.’s current performance against the best in class, high performers, industry average, and the average of companies of similar size. When conducting this exercise you should establish benchmarks with a similar logic. ABC Co. Margin Benchmarks and TargetsBenchmarkGross MarginOperating MarginEBITDA MarginBest in Class83.1%26.9%28.3%High Performer80.0%18.0%20.0%Industry Average77.3%14.9%16.5%Similar Size Average66.3%13.4%15.0%ABC Co. FY 202367.4%14.0%15.0%Targets77.3%18.0%20.0% ABC Co. management can see that it’s lagging behind the industry average in all margin metrics, though slightly outperforming the similarly sized companies’ average in gross margin and operating margin. As any management team should, ABC Co. leadership wants to deliver best-in-class performance. However, they feel that initially targeting best in class would be a daunting task for their employees and, not wanting to burn out their staff, decide to conduct the optimization process in iterative steps. After some discussion about the current state of the organization and the type of improvements that seem feasible based on current capabilities, they decide to target the high-performer EBITDA margins benchmark first. Step 2: Identify Levers to Optimize Profitability With benchmarks and targets established, management can move on to the next step of the strategy building process: identifying the operational levers that will lead to the targeted results, and then sanity-testing those targets. Based on my experience with various clients, I know it can be tempting for leadership to focus on reducing operating expenses and implementing cost-out initiatives as a path to optimized profitability. Undoubtedly, operating costs and efficiency are significant factors in any overall strategy. However, management is doing a disservice to the organization if it overlooks the role revenue and gross margins can play in optimizing profit, as there may be ample opportunity to improve the product portfolio, pricing strategy, or cost of sales. These improvements can have a significant impact on EBITDA margins. Regarding the income statement, I like to take a top-down approach to identifying operating levers so that revenue is the first item under review. The guiding questions during this stage of the process should be: What revenue factors contribute most significantly to EBITDA margins? Which of these factors does management have the most control over? Which of these factors can help management differentiate the business and establish a competitive advantage? While the individual answers differ for all organizations, the most significant factors typically come from the following areas: Product offerings: Evaluating product offerings can reveal opportunities to improve gross profit margins, which will flow through to EBITDA margins. Important metrics to consider include product mix, product quality, unit pricing, return rates, product adoption, and cross-selling or upselling success. Sales operations: These metrics may uncover opportunities to improve the sales process, as measured by units sold, higher-margin units sold, reduced sales cycle times, and higher win rates for closed deals. Customer satisfaction: Often overlooked, customer satisfaction doesn’t show up directly in the income statement—though net promoter scores, customer reviews, customer churn, and the average annual customer service contacts per customer are good indicators. However, customer satisfaction is critical to maximizing profit: Having highly satisfied customers results in lower levels of churn and returns, more frequent repeat purchases, and positive word-of-mouth marketing, which reduces customer acquisition costs, among other benefits. Operating efficiency: This is the primary focus of most profit optimization exercises, but it should never be the only one. There’s always an opportunity to become more efficient and improve operating costs. Example metrics to evaluate include operating expense ratios, employee wages as a percentage of revenue, revenue per dollar of wages, and return on ad spend. Different industries will have many improvement opportunities. For example, manufacturing companies can examine throughput, machine downtimes, cycle times, and utilization, while financial services companies can review loan processing times, fraud detection, and customer churn. These areas of focus provide an all-encompassing evaluation of organizational performance and the factors that influence operating margins. After performing internal and external benchmarking, ABC Co. produced the following analysis, detailing some of the drivers of EBITDA margin performance. We can see that internal, competitor, and industry performance all play a role in the evaluation. ABC Co. Analysis of Potential Levers to Drive Optimal ProfitabilityProduct OfferingProduct mixABC Co. and its key competitors offer a similar suite of products.Trial conversionOnly 20% of customers purchase a subscription after a free trial, below the industry average.Product qualityProduct offerings are feature-rich compared to competitors.Unit pricingABC Co.’s base offering is below competitor pricing, while its premium offering is roughly 10% more expensive.Sales OperationsSales cycleSales increased 22% versus the previous year.Win ratesWin rates have remained in line with prior years.Average deal valueDeals have increased 3% versus last year, in line with average price increases.Customer SatisfactionChurnCustomer base churn is 30% annually, higher than the industry average.SentimentThere are indications that certain product features can be complicated to implement and use.Operating EfficiencyEmployee turnoverTurnover has increased to 40% from 25% over the past year.Revenue/$ of wagesRevenue per dollar of wages is 15% lower than industry average, and 11% lower than that of key competitors.Return on ad spendROI of ad spend has decreased compared to previous years, and is 0.5x lower than industry averages. As you can see, ABC Co. has uncovered valuable insights that will help inform its margin expansion strategy going forward. Here are the key action items resulting from this analysis: Improve communication of product value, as indicated by low percentage of customers purchasing subscriptions after free trial. Improve pricing strategy, as indicated by competitor pricing and low revenue per dollar of wages metric. Improve sales training and processes, as indicated by increasing sales cycles and stagnant average deal values that will negatively impact margins. Improve customer experience and satisfaction, as indicated by high rate of customer churn and poor customer sentiment shared in reviews and feedback. Improve organizational structure, commission plans, and other forms of compensation, and workplace culture, as indicated by low revenue per dollar of wages and high employee turnover. Step 3: Sensitize and Prioritize Margin Improvement Initiatives Once the biggest areas of opportunity have been identified, the next step is to discover, via a sensitivity analysis, which of these presents the most risk to EBITDA margins, and which offers the most potential improvement. This analysis allows management to start developing a plan to attack the deficiencies and expand margins. While ideally the business would focus on all areas of improvement simultaneously, in reality that may not be possible. Prioritizing the initiatives is essential to allocating resources to the most potent activities possible. During this step, consider the following factors for each improvement opportunity: The degree of control management has over the opportunity The time it will take to make a change that has a significant impact on margins What it will realistically take to achieve the maximum potential improvement, assuming the most likely scenario How significantly each metric impacts margins In my experience, the best way to approach this task is with a dynamic operating model in Excel that incorporates the key drivers of performance as independent variables that feed the rest of the model. While building an operating model is beyond the scope of this article, I’ll note that treating important operating levers as independent variables allows management to measure the impact of each variable in isolation, thus establishing its sensitivity to EBITDA margins and revealing the most important initiatives. Continuing with our example: With the operating levers (independent variables) selected and the model completed, ABC Co. management calculated the specific sensitivities in the table below. The sensitivity calculation measures the percentage change in EBITDA margin for each 1% improvement in each of the chosen operating levers. Historical data and the correlation between individual operating levers and EBITDA margin can provide additional context. ABC & Co.

A 1% increase in sales mix results in a 0.5% increase in EBITDA margin, while increasing customer growth by 1% or decreasing customer acquisition costs by 1% results in only a 0.1% increase in EBITDA margin. With sensitivities established, the next task is to determine the maximum expected improvement for each of these initiatives. Keep in mind the considerations mentioned earlier: the degree of control and the timeline for implementation. For the sake of simplicity, we’ll assume similar timelines for all potential initiatives, and the likelihood that improvements in one area will help other areas, compounding the effect on margins. (For example, decreased customer churn implies greater customer satisfaction, which can then contribute to reduced customer acquisition costs and lead to increased customer growth.) Taking revenue per dollar of wages as an example, we can see that a 1% improvement results in a 0.4% margin boost. Some options to increase this metric include: Raising subscription prices for new customers while grandfathering in old customers to increase revenue. Improving the mix of premium subscription sales to increase revenue. Revising the commission structure to align sales incentives with strategic objectives. Reducing employee turnover and its associated costs. There are many other possibilities; the point is that conducting this exercise for each initiative allows management to apply an expected range of outcomes and prioritize its options. ABC Co. produced the following output after establishing the best-case, base-case, and worst-case scenarios for each of its initiatives. Percentage ImprovementEBITDA Margin ImpactPriorityLikelihood25%50%25% Best Case Base Case Worst Case Expected ScenarioBest CaseBase CaseWorst CasePremium Sales Mix10.0%5.0%1.0%4.7%2.5%0.5%2.5%1Customer Growth25.0%12.0%5.0%1.2%0.6%0.3%0.7%5Customer Acquisition Cost20.0%10.0%4.0%2.1%1.0%0.4%1.1%4Customer Churn10.0%5.0%0.0%3.0%1.5%0.0%1.5%3Revenue/$ of Wages15.0%6.0%1.0%4.7%2.1%0.4%2.3%2 Assuming that these are new initiatives, ABC Co. leadership applied a subjective weight to each scenario, based on their judgment of its likelihood. If you have historical data from prior initiatives, that can also be used to inform the weights assigned to each case. By calculating the weighted average of each scenario, ABC Co. management was able to come up with an expected EBITDA margin improvement for each initiative it identified. Since we’ve decided that for simplicity’s sake, time and degree of control are nonfactors in this example, the initiatives were then prioritized from the most impactful (premium sales mix) to least impactful (customer growth). Step 4: Communicate and Implement With the initiatives defined and prioritized, management now must communicate the plan of action to the rest of the organization and begin implementation. This requires as much care and planning as what has come before. The most well-defined plans will come to nothing without the right communication strategy, resources, and capabilities to support a successful outcome. Here are the components to prioritize: Project management hierarchy: A well-defined project hierarchy establishes accountability and creates a chain of communication and decision-making that helps improve efficiency. Clearly outlined responsibilities allow management to see where bottlenecks exist and act quickly to implement solutions. Open and clear communication: This is a basic management principle and is widely applicable outside of profit optimization initiatives. Explaining the project’s strategy and expectations in an organized, transparent way helps to create a sense of ownership and buy-in from the employees charged with executing the plan. Additionally, promoting feedback and employee engagement can reveal new, innovative solutions that management may not have considered otherwise. Formal progress reviews: Periodic reviews signal the importance of the initiative to employees. A lack of attention from management will lead to a lack of attention from employees, and result in stagnation and failure. Resources and support: These initiatives are significant undertakings. It’s essential to be able to adapt the strategic plan and pivot quickly. New processes or tools may need to be developed or implemented. Management must be committed to providing whatever is needed for the team to achieve the desired margin expansion, or the effort will fail. With transparency and sufficient resources, team members will be equipped with what they need to stay committed and motivated to deliver significant improvements to the organization’s overall performance. As we saw in the example above, the expected EBITDA margin improvement for ABC Co. adds up to 8.1%, assuming all initiatives are successful. That’s an additional $1.6M of EBITDA based on the company’s 2023 revenue. Even if it only achieves half the stated goals above, it adds 4% to the EBITDA margin. For Best Results, Review Annually By using the four-step approach outlined in this article, your organization will be able to successfully define a comprehensive strategy for optimizing profits. Best of all, this can be utilized as an iterative tool that supports several rounds of profit optimization initiatives until you’ve reached the targets you’re aiming for. The benefit of this approach is that it identifies the most effective levers for improving profitability—which may extend well beyond simply reducing operating costs—enabling management to allocate resources appropriately and move quickly and confidently. Once the optimization process begins, the procedures outlined in the implementation stage help management quickly identify and address challenges. I recommend integrating this profit optimization exercise into your organization’s annual planning process in order to keep priorities up to date. Should an economic downturn occur, your organization will be in the best position to withstand it. If there is no downturn, your organization will be primed to make smarter investments in growth initiatives. Either way, your company will be prepared for whatever the future holds.

Read MoreExpertiseManagement ConsultingPrevious RoleCEOPREVIOUSLY ATShareShare I’ve been working as a corporate strategy consultant with entrepreneurs and small businesses for more than a decade, helping them solve problems as they seek to grow. But before that, I trained as an engineer, working in research and design for the Renault Formula 1 racing team (now Alpine F1 Team), then in technology projects for Airbus. When you’re designing race cars and airplanes, there’s no room for error—precision is essential. However, when I moved into consulting, I noticed that scientific precision was frequently in short supply, often resulting in wasted time and money. In a typical consultant-client relationship, the client will notice a problem, identify the culprit, and then call a consultant to help fix it. The consultant will then focus on that area of underperformance, collecting data, developing hypotheses, building solutions, and analyzing the results. However, the client doesn’t always know what the problem actually is—and it may not be what they had assumed. For example, the client may be concerned about low sales, and assume the problem is that they’re targeting the wrong customers. But in fact the problem may be that the product itself is flawed, or that it’s not being positioned properly. Even when the consultant recognizes that there may be other factors in play, the traditional methods of discovery, analysis, and solution building often require a substantial investment of time, effort, and money before anyone knows whether the solution is hitting the mark. Executing on growth and innovation as part of corporate strategy often starts with problem analysis and the problem-solving frameworks used in product management and design thinking. Knowing how to break down large problems into smaller questions helps clarify roadblocks and speed the development of solutions. While there are a number of business problem-solving methodologies available to facilitate that process, I have never found one that gets to the true heart of the matter as quickly as I’d like. I knew from my years as a Formula 1 and aerospace engineer that there had to be a more efficient way to identify problems and test solutions without compromising thoroughness. Using my knowledge and experience, I developed a two-part process to identify root causes and test solutions. It involves some extra research in the beginning, but ultimately allows me to arrive at solutions much more efficiently. I call it competitive management methodology, and here I show you how it works. Part 1: Identify the Root Cause of Current Problems When challenges arise in a business—for example, underperforming sales—managers and consultants will often ask big questions: What’s not working in our current go-to-market strategy? Could we sell more by changing the price? Would adding more features to the product help? What other customer groups could we target? These are good questions to ask, but they’re not precise enough to reveal the problem. Furthermore, they often reflect the biases or hunches of those in charge, rather than the actual root cause. The F1 mindset means that you need to turn over every stone in search of trouble spots, without making assumptions about where the cause might lie. The competitive management methodology begins with a 360-degree survey of the company’s performance. This allows me to see where different domains intersect to contribute to the problem, and ultimately helps me provide more holistic solutions. These are the eight domains I examine: Purpose Clients Market Suppliers and Partners Talent and Team Organization and Processes Financial Analysis Competitive Values For each category, I use a questionnaire asking stakeholders a series of simple questions to determine how thoroughly they have structured and optimized these areas and how well each is performing. These questions are the same for every company I assist. To ensure unbiased results, I speak to stakeholders all across the company about every domain—not just the area they’re responsible for. For each of the eight domains, I note whether the question is relevant to the business I’m working with at the time, assign points to rank how much improvement is needed, then convert those points into a percentage value. Here is an example of the financial analysis portion of the questionnaire: Financial AnalysisRelevantPoints% ValueHave you performed a profitability analysis for each product or service? 0 = no 1 = yes x/13x%What is the total profitability of your business? 0 = no 1 = yes x/8x%Do you have a budget, and do you review it as often as your business requires? 0 = no 1 = yes x/13x%Do you perform cash flow analyses, and do you review them periodically? 0 = no 1 = yes x/13x%Do you automatically set aside a portion of your income to increase your margin or to fund reserves and cover anticipated losses? 0 = no 1 = yes x/13x%Are your personal accounts separate from your business accounts? 0 = no 1 = yes x/3x%Total point value x/63Number of relevant questions x/6Total percentage value x%/100% After assigning percentage values for each question, I add up the answers to arrive at a total percentage between 1% and 100%, with 1% indicating a highly refined, high-performing area that needs little intervention, and 100% indicating a severe lack of development in that area requiring extensive intervention. Finally, I map the results of all domains to a spiderweb chart to identify the top three areas in greatest need of improvement and with the highest potential for impact on the company overall. While the answers may confirm the client’s suspicions, they can also reveal undiscovered problems that may be contributing to the end problem the client is seeing. Only after I’ve identified the primary three areas of concern do I deploy more traditional problem identification techniques such as the Five Whys. Here is what my process looks like in action. Case Study: Identifying the Real Problem I once consulted for a major digital marketing agency that was having difficulty with its workflows and objective-setting processes. After I ran the founders through my questionnaire, I discovered that while their processes did need optimizing, the following were their most pressing problems: The founders’ responsibilities were not clearly laid out, which led to areas of overlap or neglect. The team was not flexible enough. There were bottlenecks. Team costs were excessive or not optimized throughout the whole team structure. The agency’s operating margin was declining. So the core question shifted from “How can we improve our workflows and objective-setting processes to save money?” to “How can we optimize our team structure to improve performance?” However, not every part of a team works the same way, so the next step was to get even more granular: How could we optimize for staff to improve their performance? For managers? For department heads? For C-suite leaders? In this case it was crucial to classify each role according to aspects such as strategic know-how, frequency that know-how is required, cost, and even target revenue per type of employee. For instance, the chief marketing officer would possess one of the most critical parts of the company’s know-how: the ability to design a digital marketing strategy for every new customer e-learning product. This role would be required on every new and existing project, and the company would do well to invest in keeping such a key professional on staff. The chief financial officer, on the other hand, could be a highly qualified fractional professional. This expert would jump on board for a short period of time to analyze finances, set the overall controller process, identify key indicators to track, and even help develop a business plan projection. They could then hand the reins to a full-time, permanent financial controller to oversee the day-to-day finances. Finally, the person in charge of implementing and tracking marketing campaigns on social media, following the company’s designed strategy, could be a long-term contract employee, since that role does not demand high strategic know-how, but rather is primarily responsible for executing the final strategy and managing the data. Once the work of classifying roles was complete, I was able to develop a hypothetical solution. It included: Drawing up a founders’ agreement outlining the responsibilities of each founder. Designating key strategic long-term and/or permanent roles to keep in-house. Identifying strategic short-term or periodic projects and tasks and contracting out for those services as needed to expert freelancers or top agencies. Determining whether it makes sense from a financial and company culture perspective to outsource any departments, such as a call center or the marketing analytics team. Making sure that the result prioritizes the right goals: flexibility, high performance, and cost efficiency. Keep the company culture for the core team—and recognize that the optimal return on investment may not necessarily mean hiring the cheapest labor. With this hypothesis in place, it was time to test. Part 2: Embrace Minimum Viable Testing of Corporate Strategies In corporate strategy, too often clients want to commit to a solution right away. But the process will be faster, cheaper, and more effective if you start smaller. F1 teams deploy a rigorously scientific approach, improving vehicle performance incrementally, primarily through using computer simulations and aerodynamic data produced by testing car models in wind tunnels. What I learned is that the teams that test their hypotheses most often and the most efficiently—by prioritizing the most impactful tests—are the ones that produce an advantage. When implementing this insight in other fields, the challenge is to develop a framework that enables you to test more, test better, and test as cheaply as possible. The way to do that in corporate strategy is through the minimum viable test (MVT) methodology. Most entrepreneurs are familiar with the concept of a minimum viable product (MVP). An MVT is a related process that breaks down a business idea or feature into a series of small, hypothetical tests conducted even before the beta version is attempted. Popularized by serial entrepreneur Gagan Biyani, the methodology requires you to come up with a list of fundamental assumptions about your idea—the assumptions that absolutely must be correct in order to succeed—and then devise what are known as “atomic unit tests” to evaluate each of these core assumptions individually on a very small scale. For example, if your idea is a digital toothbrush subscription service, one of your atomic unit tests might be to send out a survey to determine whether people are interested in buying toothbrushes online in the first place. Competitive management methodology includes one key aspect that derives from the F1 mindset: First focus on finding out which options don’t work and can be discarded, rather than aiming to find out which options can potentially work. In other words: Don’t worry so much about looking for the needle in the haystack at first—just go for the hay, so you can discard it quickly. Not every test needs to be conducted in the real world; by asking a thoughtfully worded question that isolates one core assumption at a time, you can use simple inductive and deductive thinking to discard many bad ideas quickly. Sometimes the answers are very obvious, and that’s OK. The more granular and well-worded the questions are, the easier it will be to shortlist your ideas and narrow them down to find the optimal answer. Here’s how I did this for the digital marketing company. Case Study: Discovering and Implementing the Right Test While many consultants would have simply rolled out the new structure companywide for a trial period or would have picked a team and project based on intuition and hunches, I wanted to test it on a carefully selected single team and project. In order to determine the characteristics that the team/project combination should have in order to test the hypotheses, I first applied MVT methodology to the test design itself: Should we pilot the new structure with a team of new hires who were less familiar with the company but had never been exposed to the problematic processes, or should we use a team of people who had already been there for a while? Should the new structure involve people from all levels of the hierarchy, i.e., line workers to C and founder levels, or just one layer of personnel, such as middle managers? Would it be better to test an existing project to check improvements in key indicators, or a new project to ensure that it did not incorporate any of the old bad habits? By breaking down our assumptions about the ideal test and challenging them one by one, I quickly realized that if we didn’t test the new structure on a completely new team and project, we would never know how much of the result was due to the new structure and how much was due to residual practices or biases from the old way of doing things. In other words, by not implementing the test properly, we would end up wasting time and money trying to isolate those factors further. Similarly, we realized that because we could never completely isolate the activities of just one layer of the hierarchy, we would need to test the structure on everyone from line workers to leadership. These thought experiments led us to roll out the new structure for a totally new team working on a short-term special project—the launch of an e-learning offering. This gave us real-world results that we could extrapolate more confidently to the full team structure, and also limited the impact of the change on the company’s revenue and operations while I fine-tuned it. Considering that part of the test involved determining the right mix of permanent staffers and contract workers, we elected to start with in-house staff, including the person designing the marketing strategy (for this small company, it was the CEO), the director of HR, highly specialized support staff, and the copywriting staff. While arguably copywriters could have been outsourced, we found that bringing them on full time made more sense because the need for their skills was long term and their work was tightly linked to the company’s strategy. On the other hand, we were able to outsource a number of roles in customer support, video production, and marketing analytics. This mix made it much easier for the team to scale and contract as needs shifted throughout the launch cycle—for example, transitioning from a heavily sales-oriented support team at the beginning to technical and learning support once people began using the e-learning course. Once data indicators showed consistently improved profitability, operations, and customer and employee experience, we adapted, scaled, and implemented the new structure companywide. The Competitive Management Methodology in Corporate Strategy The competitive management methodology is a blend of scientific approach, tight deadlines, and substantial budget optimization. In order to succeed, you need to understand your weaknesses and rigorously challenge each assumption—with an eye toward filtering out what doesn’t work first—before implementing a new improvement. Even when there isn’t a problem that needs to be corrected, startup and small business leaders can use this approach to evaluate any new strategy option—a price change, a new product launch or feature, the targeting of a new customer group, or an entirely new business idea. You should ask yourself: What is the simplest, quickest, and least expensive way that I can test this and still achieve a result that is representative enough to indicate which option is more likely to work? By taking the time on the front end to seek out the root cause of problems and testing your hypothesis as much as you can, you will arrive at your solution and refine your corporate strategy more efficiently and effectively.

Read MoreExpertiseGrowth StrategyPrevious RoleMarketing Manager PREVIOUSLY ATShareShareWhen startup funding is tight, marketing can feel like a luxury—even if it isn’t. Fortunately for founders, relevant technologies driven by artificial intelligence (AI) can amplify the efforts of a small marketing team. In fact, according to a Bain & Company survey of nearly 600 companies in 11 industries, almost 40% of respondents said they’re already using or considering using generative AI to speed the development of marketing collateral. And a majority of global business leaders expect a rapid adoption of AI-powered marketing tools in the next two years, with 90% of those surveyed by McKinsey & Company anticipating frequent use of generative AI. One reason for this quick adoption is that marketing is characterized by a convergence of creative and data-driven tasks—a combination that makes this area a prime target for disruption by generative AI. As a digital marketing specialist who works with startups, established businesses, and thought leaders to expand reach and grow sales on limited budgets, I have found AI to be crucial to the services I provide. It enables startups in particular to perform essential marketing tasks, such as web analytics, search engine optimization, and email outreach, speedily and at significantly lower costs at a time when scarce funding is making many projects otherwise difficult or impossible. As companies integrate AI tools into their marketing functions, one major challenge is picking the right solution for their specific needs. The dizzying pace and variety of today’s AI offerings have even the most tech-savvy business owners racing to keep up. Take ChatGPT, the popular AI chatbot by OpenAI that can perform data analysis, content generation, and other marketing-related tasks. It’s been in the public domain for barely a year but it already has more than 1.7 billion users. And it’s just one of many new AI tools and platforms being rolled out and regularly updated in a race among the world’s biggest tech companies to stay ahead. The first thing to know about the new AI-powered marketing platforms is that they don’t change what you need to achieve to market your business. Rather, they change how you can go about accomplishing those tasks. By handling much of the heavy lifting for routine tasks—e.g., analyzing real-time data and autogenerating personalized marketing content—AI can save you time and money. But it’s important to note that human insight and creativity remain crucial. AI-powered tools lack intuition, emotions, and cultural sensitivities—qualities that make humans more effective in creative tasks such as adding unique touches and ensuring alignment with the brand’s data needs, core values, and message. In this article, I show you how AI can help companies meet five key marketing objectives. Understanding Customer Preferences Any good marketing strategy includes tailoring messages to customer interests, behaviors, and preferences. This kind of personal attention makes customers feel understood and valued, thus cementing their connection to the brand. This can result in higher engagement, stronger loyalty, improved conversion rates—and ultimately more sales. Executing such a strategy involves data analysis, segmentation, content creation, and implementation. It can be time-consuming, labor-intensive, and expensive, often requiring additional staff, specialized software, or third-party services—resources not always available to smaller businesses and early-stage startups. One of my clients, a small fashion shop, wanted to understand the preferences of its customer base. Before AI-powered solutions, the boutique’s owners collected purchase histories and customer feedback forms and conducted surveys, accumulating piles of data over several months. Once they had sufficient information about customers’ buying preferences, the next step was to hire a consultant to sift through it for marketing insights. However, for a fraction of the cost—potentially $10,000 to $25,000 annually, depending on the scope of work—AI tools like ChatGPT and Adobe Experience Platform can analyze vast amounts of marketing data generated when customers shop online or visit a website. The data collection includes customers’ browsing histories, purchase histories, and what items they’ve clicked on. These tools can even track social media activity related to your products, depending on customer privacy settings. Then the AI uses algorithms to identify patterns, trends, correlations, and preferences in the data. An AI tool can segment customers based on their behavior and preferences, grouping those who frequently purchase similar items or exhibit similar browsing habits—making it much easier for a company to offer personalized products. These platforms can also track customer journeys through the sales funnel, identifying where customers drop off and revealing problems such as a confusing checkout process or irrelevant content. Some AI-powered applications can use existing data to extrapolate and predict future customer behavior and purchases, empowering a company to offer customized product suggestions to customers through email campaigns with suggestions based on past purchases, pop-up recommendations, or even invitations to chat with a virtual assistant that can suggest products based on search and browsing history. Companies can implement these tools in alignment with their brand’s strategy, ensuring a coherent experience for the customer. Improving Customer Targeting In order to attract, acquire, and retain customers, companies need a good grasp of user behavior. For smaller companies without robust marketing functions, this might require purchasing third-party data and insights and then hiring outside analysts to help develop the personalized content required to keep customers coming back. In my experience, the costs for these services can range from a few thousand to tens of thousands of dollars, depending on the scope and scale. One tool that can slash those costs is Tableau AI, an analytics platform that charges less than $100 per user per month. Tableau can analyze customers’ behavior by comparing them to successful conversion paths in relevant industries and identifying where customers might drop off, potentially saving a small team significant time and money. Companies can then use this information to tweak their marketing tactics and make data-driven changes to sales processes and customer experiences, ensuring that they are focusing their efforts on customers likely to make a purchase. This is just one way that AI can save money by reducing the need for third-party services or specialized software. Here are platforms I recommend to companies looking to improve their customer targeting: Adobe Experience Platform provides real-time customer segmentation and targeting. At $50,000 or more a year, this can be an expensive option, but it may be an appropriate investment depending on your company’s needs. Salesforce Einstein is an analytics tool that integrates with Salesforce’s customer relationship management platform and helps businesses automate lead scoring and segment customers. Einstein’s pricing varies according to your company’s specific Salesforce package. Google Analytics 4 is a free tool that provides substantial user behavior insights and integrates with ad platforms. Google plans to incorporate AI to help companies identify ads that connect most with customers, making it useful for smaller businesses seeking to track and improve their advertising efforts. Google also offers an enterprise-level version called Google Analytics 360, which costs about $150,000 annually. Automating Customer Support AI-driven chatbots and email bots improve customer support by enhancing scalability, personalization, and resource optimization. With sufficient guidance, tools such as ChatGPT, Ada, and Google’s Dialogflow are virtually indistinguishable from humans during support conversations. Another advantage of AI in the customer support space is that these tools are always available when customers need help. One travel startup I recently worked with implemented ChatGPT to handle routine inquiries such as “How do I change the dates for my trip?” or “What’s your cancellation policy?” After the implementation, the need for support staff dropped by 30%, all without sacrificing customer satisfaction. Another startup client reduced response time to customers by 40% and increased customer satisfaction using Zendesk AI and Dialogflow. These tools offer more advanced ticketing and support automation than ChatGPT by using virtual agents—machine-learning chatbots that operate mostly without the need for real-time human supervision. Zendesk AI and Dialogflow are ideal for small- to medium-sized enterprises with complex customer queries. Their 24/7 availability and learning capabilities further enable companies to enhance customer experiences and manage complexity effectively, generally at far lower costs than round-the-clock staffing. To measure performance of the tools, businesses can prompt customers for feedback after an AI-powered chat or call. This can be done through a simple survey of customers’ satisfaction level with the response they received. AI chat systems can automatically run a sentiment analysis of responses such as “Thanks, that’s helpful!” and “That doesn’t help at all” to assess a user’s level of satisfaction. For nonroutine or complex queries that fall outside the AI’s training, AI systems can suggest transferring the user to a human representative, emailing customer service, or calling a support number. Or the chatbot may offer a general response or send a link to a relevant FAQ section. Beyond simple customer support, Dialogflow can create dynamic conversational chatbots that assist with more complex inquiries, provide personalized recommendations, and even facilitate sales processes. For example, Dialogflow can be set up (with the appropriate back-end integrations) to search through a product database and provide answers to product-specific questions. As helpful as these and other AI tools can be for customer service and marketing, they don’t replace the need for human involvement, particularly in training and customer interactions. Rather, AI empowers workers to shift their focus from lead nurturing to lead qualification and activation in later stages. Creating Engaging Social Media Visuals Establishing and maintaining a social media presence takes considerable time and energy because it requires a constant stream of new, company-specific ideas, monitoring, and creative collateral such as images. Even dedicated social media editors have their hands full managing a company’s presence across the multitude of social platforms. AI can lend a strong assist here too. Tools such as Canva’s free AI image generator, Midjourney, and DALL-E 2 can create images for use on social media and make it easier to create a cohesive visual aesthetic for your business across platforms. However, I want to note that generating images is one of the most contentious areas in AI-powered marketing tools. Critics of AI-generated images argue that since the AI has been trained on existing images that were created by human artists it is in effect plagiarizing artists’ work. Those who support this latest evolution in image creation counter that each AI-generated image is unique, and that the result largely depends on the prompt given by a human. The debate about what to do—not just the morality—is ongoing in the absence of regulations. Despite this uncertainty, and amid legal challenges, the market for AI-generated images is growing fast. AI-driven visual content tools—Midjourney, DALL-E 2 (integrated with Bing Chat’s Copilot), Adobe Firefly (which is incorporated into newer versions of Photoshop), and Amazon Rekognition generate images from text prompts and comparable visual examples. For a company looking to get away from stock pictures and other generic images, these tools can produce one-of-a-kind images to match a company’s brand. The continual learning capabilities of AI mean that these tools can refine and improve visual content generation over time, staying on brand and effective without constant human oversight. For my clients who want to sidestep copyright and plagiarism concerns, I recommend using the Adobe Firefly image generator, which protects against infringement on intellectual property rights by drawing from Adobe’s own portfolio of stock media and freely licensed images. Open AI’s DALL-E 3 offers certain protections as well, such as rejecting requests for images made in the style of a living artist. Crafting Effective Email Marketing Campaigns Traditionally, effective email marketing has required human effort at every stage, involving coordination between writers, designers, marketing managers, and possibly even IT staff. It’s especially time-consuming and expensive for companies without in-house expertise, since they will likely have to outsource these tasks. AI can automate many email marketing processes, including segmenting audiences based on behavior and engagement, generating personalized content, designing visually appealing layouts, and even testing different versions of a marketing email to see which one performs best. I frequently advise smaller startups on a budget, particularly those in the e-commerce space, to use the free version of ChatGPT to write their newsletter copy. AI Tools Need Human Partners AI can generate marketing content based on templates, past content, brand guidelines, and audience insights—but that data needs to be thoughtfully curated by a human. Fortunately, training and using AI marketing tools doesn’t require deep technical expertise. Many technologies offer user-friendly interfaces and customer support to guide nontechnical users through the process. (That said, collaboration with a technical team member or an external expert can also give your company a firm foundation in AI and be helpful for more complex implementations.) When properly trained and used, AI tools can deliver effective marketing materials for startups and smaller companies at a fraction of the cost of a full marketing staff or outside vendor. Experiment with these tools and find the ones that best align with your company’s business objectives. You’re likely to find, as I have, that AI can handle much of the drudgery of routine marketing tasks, freeing up people to focus their insight and creativity on what matters most.

Leveraging his expertise as a KPMG-qualified auditor, he has also led fraud and risk analyses for businesses of every size. Read MoreExpertiseBusiness Process Optimization ConsultingRisk Management ConsultingCorporate GovernancePrevious RoleSVP of FinancePREVIOUSLY ATShareShare In the wake of a number of high-profile startup frauds, it’s high time to dispel the myth that business controls impede growth. While excessive or poorly implemented checks and balances can hold back a rapidly scaling company, it is possible to design a progressive control framework that empowers a growing company to achieve the seemingly contradictory objectives of risk management and agility. We’ve seen what happens when controls go out the window—just look at FTX. When former Enron recovery chair John Ray III took control of FTX following CEO Sam Bankman-Fried’s arrest, he described the company’s corporate controls as a “complete failure,” citing inadequate governance, irresponsible cash management processes, and the concentration of authority within a small, inexperienced group of decision-makers, among other issues. As a KPMG-qualified auditor with 17 years of experience working in senior finance roles at large enterprises and fast-growing venture-backed startups, I am always surprised at how common lax controls are among smaller businesses and early-stage startups feeling pressure to scale quickly. Unfortunately, these companies are particularly susceptible to avoidable losses due to poorly designed or implemented controls. There are opportunity costs to lax controls too: The cost of capital has jumped sharply following record interest rate increases, making fundraising considerably more difficult. That increase also makes investors much more cautious, incentivizing them to perform more rigorous due diligence than ever before. I recently assisted an early-stage company with a Series A funding round, and found that the breadth and depth of the diligence was stronger than any other process I had experienced before. For example, the investor asked about the payment release strategy and wanted to know what approval levels the company had in place within the payment processing solution. In the past, this level of detail was uncommon at this investment stage. In this article, I show you how embracing a thoughtfully designed progressive control system can support your company’s success, both by minimizing risk and reassuring investors. The Case for Business Controls Business controls—or internal controls—are the policies, procedures, and practices designed and implemented within a business to safeguard its assets, ensure accurate financial reporting, and promote operational efficiency. Each internal control component, such as segregation of duties, authorization procedures, and regular monitoring, contributes to the overall system of business controls. The importance of controls grows proportionally with the size of the company, and more specifically, with the number of employees working in that organization. This risk is exacerbated by the trend toward a remote workforce. The post-COVID-19 shift in organizational design has rendered many traditional controls obsolete; for example, physically signing checks to pay suppliers at the end of the month has generally been replaced by a digital payment release strategy. In a small company with a single decision-maker (the CEO), every choice and action directly reflects that individual’s responsibility. Take the founder of a pre-seed startup looking to contract with an important software vendor. When they personally decide which vendor to partner with, the repercussions of a poor choice fall squarely on their shoulders, affecting both finances and operations. In pursuit of speed, the CEO might choose to forego a rigorous RFP process and accept the associated risks. Just as likely, they may not be aware of what a sound vendor selection review looks like, or even more likely, be so busy that they don’t have the time to undertake such a review. However, as the company grows, the CEO has to make a choice: Continue to make all the calls and risk creating a bottleneck, or delegate some of those decisions to, for example, a newly hired VP of Operations. However, no matter how much the CEO trusts the new VP, trust is not a scalable solution. Without a control framework, the VP will follow their own selection process, and in doing so may expose the company to excess risk disproportionate to their level of responsibility. Likewise, the CEO may not have a clear sense of those decisions to delegate and those to retain, which can send them veering haphazardly between micromanagement and disengagement. A progressive internal control framework allows the CEO to manage the risks their company is exposed to while sustaining the heartbeat of the organization. How to Develop a Control Framework I have created smart, progressive internal control frameworks for rapidly growing companies by adapting my training and experience at larger, more formally organized corporations. These frameworks are designed to reduce avoidable losses and help secure venture capital funding without sacrificing agility. Document Specific Risk and Control Factors My best-practice advice is to begin by assessing and documenting the following risk and control factors for your company. Doing so will ensure that consensus and a common understanding are reached on these key topics, and will allow decision-makers to build efficient workflows while managing risk appropriately. Operating complexity considers the current headcount, staffing model (remote versus office-based, W2s versus contractors, onshore versus offshore, etc.), operating locations (single trading location, number of countries, etc.), business model, and customer base. The more complex a company is, the greater the need for closer monitoring. Technological sophistication allows a company to deploy a wide range of automated controls and is a key pillar for streamlining a control framework. A large organization typically employs more technology across all departments, which increases complexity but allows for great efficiency in the design of automated business controls. Materiality is the threshold below which you would be able to tolerate financial discrepancies, errors, or deviations in your processes. Anything above this materiality threshold must trigger immediate action or reporting. When considering materiality I will look at both the financial and nonfinancial impacts (e.g., loss of reputation or customer trust). A lower threshold for materiality demands greater control. Risk tolerance is a form of materiality that is especially useful when it’s difficult to estimate a monetary value. It also allows a CEO or founder to define their judgment and risk tolerance, even if only subjectively, as if to say, “I’m prepared to tolerate unauthorized subscription discounts from the sales team as long as we’re growing.” This sentiment will likely evolve over time, and documenting it now provides a useful comparison for reference. A higher risk tolerance allows for looser controls. A fundraising stage is a common and important trigger for a more secure control framework to be implemented, as investors will have higher expectations for larger companies. Angel and other noninstitutional investors will seldom inquire about business controls, whereas a Series D VC fund leading a $100M round is likely to review the company’s business controls in some detail before closing the round. A good understanding of these factors is the foundation for a progressive control system as they impact how many controls are included in the control framework, how often controls are triggered, and how effective controls are at preventing or detecting unauthorized actions. These factors also directly influence how I use three fundamental levers—value limit (or tolerance), cadence, and objective—to design each control for each area of the organization. Calibrate the Three Levers of Control Once the documentation and evaluation of risk and control factors are complete, I use three key levers to calibrate each control with the overall risk assessment and risk appetite of each company: Value limit or tolerance: This adjusts the amount or value that triggers the control. Changing this limit greatly impacts the number of exceptions flagged for review. Cadence: This adjusts how often a control is performed, from per transaction to daily, monthly, or even annually. Objective: This defines whether the control is designed to prevent or detect unapproved events or decisions. While preventive controls are superior at minimizing risk, less disruptive detective controls are a great compromise and work well in conjunction with other core controls. The three levers can be changed according to a risk continuum: LeverLow Risk ToleranceHigh Risk ToleranceExampleValue limit or toleranceA lower value limit, which triggers a control more oftenA higher value limit, which triggers a control less oftenA department store may require a line manager to get approval before granting a refund. The control limit that triggers the need for authorization can be set to a lower value for higher-risk items (e.g., electronic equipment) and to a higher value for lower-risk items (e.g., clothes).CadencePerforming a control review frequentlyPerforming a control review less frequentlyA restaurant needs to maintain tight control over food and beverage inventory. Higher-demand inventory such as alcohol and other beverages should be counted multiple times per day, whereas vegetables and frozen foods may only be counted daily or every other day.ObjectivePreventive control, which stops an unwanted action before it occursDetective control, which identifies an unwanted action after it has occurredSystem authorization limits could either prevent an inappropriate credit note from being issued by requiring preapproval, or detect inappropriate issuances through a monthly report reviewed by management. At smaller companies, or those with a greater appetite for risk and speed, I will set higher value limits, design controls to be executed less frequently, and rely more on detective controls. I recently assisted a startup during its attempt to raise a Series A investment round. The company had a relatively small headcount and management was stretched thin trying to deliver on multiple objectives. Considering the practical reality of the company’s position, I designed a control framework that employed more detective controls and had management review these less frequently: We prepared a report at the end of each month detailing all overtime worked for client-facing staff; exceptions were investigated and recorded, and an executive summary and cost impact were shared with the wider executive team via email. We seldom had an issue, but during one month, overtime ballooned, and the VP of Operations responded with a number of corrective measures. While the excess cost could have been avoided, the additional time and effort to do so far exceeded the money lost from this single month. While some controls have clear best practices attached to them (e.g., perform a bank reconciliation for all business accounts each month), most controls can be dialed up or down to suit each entity’s specific risk appetite. What is more important is that these levers be reviewed on a regular basis (annually at minimum) in the context of the overall risk assessment, and that each control be modified to match the size and complexity of the organization at that particular time. Decide How to Delegate Authority Once your control levers are calibrated, it’s time to consider who should be empowered to deploy them. The most common challenge for leaders of growing or medium-sized entities is delegating the responsibility for business control to middle and line management. This is especially common in companies that grew from a startup or family-run business in which the key person of influence was accustomed to performing all controls personally. The majority of smaller companies I have worked with have experienced this problem, and the result is a bottleneck that slows down the business. Even worse is that the valuable time of the founder or CEO is diverted away from high-value work to administrative tasks, an exceptionally expensive situation that is often overlooked. To help leaders manage the transition, I recommend developing a “delegation of authority” matrix, also known as a “limit of authority” matrix. This is a policy document that instructs and guides all employees regarding approval limits when transacting on behalf of the company. This matrix serves as the foundation of a company’s governance framework by clarifying and quantifying the decision-making authority of each member of the management team. The matrix to address all functional areas of the business is usually developed by the CFO and approved by the company’s board of directors. Excerpt From a Typical Delegation of Authority Matrix Business AreaSub-areaTopicApproval LimitsApproval RequiredOpEx/CapExOperating ExpensesNonrecurring ExpendituresUnder $5,000Line ManagerBetween $5,000 and $20,000Senior ManagerAbove $20,000C-suiteVendor ContractsAnnualized value under $5,000Senior ManagerAnnualized value between $5,000 and $20,000C-suiteAnnualized value above $20,000C-suite and CEO In this example, the delegation of authority to a line manager to incur an operating expense on behalf of the company is limited to $5,000, and any expense greater than this will require prior approval from the next most senior person noted. A growing business faces increased complexity across the organization over time as it employs a larger workforce, processes larger transaction volumes, and handles larger sums or quantities of transactions. As complexity grows, so does risk. While many companies and executives are aware of the delegation of authority matrix and have a working understanding of its purpose, in my experience, few understand how documenting risk factors and implementing the levers I’ve described can achieve an optimal balance between risk reduction and operating efficiency. Following the approach outlined here will also help to get buy-in from the wider management team and result in greater adherence to any implemented business controls. It can also help to rein in finance teams that may default to a standard control framework that doesn’t take into account the complexity or risk tolerance of their particular company. As the company grows and decision-making authority begins to extend beyond the core founder group, the importance of this matrix becomes increasingly critical. I recommend implementing a simple version as soon as possible, and it should absolutely be done by the time you start hiring middle and line managers—usually once you have about 50 employees or so. Once your framework is in place, I think you’ll be surprised by how unobtrusive it can be, and how seamlessly it can scale with your needs. Not only that, your company will be better protected from risk, your investors will feel more secure, and your business will be better positioned to thrive. As we have learned—not just from FTX, but Theranos, Enron, and others—growth without guardrails can leave your company wide open to risk—both from within and without.

Such risks include financial risk, legal risk, operational risk, and others. What are some examples of control measures in business?Business controls can be preventive or detective in nature. A preventive financial control may involve requiring a manager’s authorization for junior staff to make certain purchases. A detective control would allow junior staff to make purchases, but require them to file a report for management to review later. What is the most common control element?While it is difficult to say which business control is the most common, virtually every company has—or should have—some type of financial control in place. These could be as rudimentary as reconciling monthly bank statements or limiting who can sign checks.

Read MoreExpertiseFractional CFOFP&AFinancial ModelingPrevious RoleCorporate Risk ManagerPREVIOUSLY ATShareShare In the post-COVID-19 economy, businesses big and small are facing new challenges in the US and global markets. Volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity have become the new norm in many industries, making it vital for companies to prioritize business resilience, particularly when it comes to budgeting, cost savings, and lowering operating leverage. One way to reduce costs in wealthier countries is global expansion. By relocating support functions to lower-cost regions overseas, business leaders can better position their companies to weather any uncertainty that may lie ahead. I run a financial advisory firm in Tbilisi, Georgia, where I’ve served as a fractional CFO for companies based in my home country as well as the US, UK, and Europe. From my work with more than 50 foreign entrepreneurs in industries from IT to manufacturing, I’ve noticed two emerging trends, both centered around global expansion: outsourcing supporting operations overseas, and opening branch offices abroad. There are a number of advantages to each solution. Outsourcing supporting operations—whether to individual contractors or other companies—can provide a nimble, cost-effective option, allowing your business to scale up or down more quickly. Opening a branch abroad also allows you to tap into global talent while spending less on operating costs than you would at your company’s headquarters, giving your organization the flexibility it needs to ride the wave of any uncertainty. Whether you simply outsource to overseas talent or expand your business abroad is a strategic decision that depends on your company, industry, and circumstances, and whose consideration lies beyond the scope of this article. Regardless of which option you choose, there are several factors to assess when considering expanding abroad, and this article focuses on key points to help you make an informed decision that’s right for your company. Ease of Doing Business When you’re opening an offshore branch or subsidiary, know that it’s easier and less expensive to start and run a business in some countries than others—choosing wisely can make a big difference to your bottom line. Considerations for ease of doing business, as these concerns are collectively known, include the freedom to operate without excessive governmental restrictions and regulations that may affect normal business operations, property rights, business rights, and bureaucracy. Many of these attributes have traditionally been measured in the World Bank’s yearly Doing Business report, which measures the business and investment climates in 180 economies worldwide. (At the time of this writing, this report is being updated and overhauled as the B-READY Project.) As an example, this chart from the World Bank compares the US and Georgian markets—ranked No. 6 and No. 7 in 2020, respectively—for their overall business environments (a lower number indicates an easier environment): Ease of Doing BusinessUSGeorgiaOverall67Starting a business552Dealing with construction permits2421Getting electricity6442Registering property395Getting credit415Protecting minority investors367Paying taxes2514Trading across borders3945Enforcing contracts1712Resolving insolvency264 As you can see from this breakdown, even though some of the two countries’ overall ratings are similar, a company seeking to expand internationally may prefer to consider Georgia over the United States in many cases, depending on what its priorities are. However, there are plenty of factors that fall outside the scope of this report, and the following are the ones that, in my experience, matter most when you are considering opening an offshore office. Starting a Business Find out how long it takes to start a business in your target location and what fees and details are involved. The easier and more streamlined the process, the less of an administrative, logistical, and financial burden it will be. In some countries it might take several months and a significant amount of money to get through the bureaucracy before you can actually start your operations, but places like New Zealand, Singapore, and Denmark are known for how easy it is to start a business there. And in Georgia, for example, once you’ve done your due diligence, it takes just one day to register a business, with all standard documents available at a national registration office, requiring only a signature and a payment of $35. There are also the logistics of finding a physical location if you need one—perhaps even building it yourself—and outfitting it. This entails renting or buying space, securing construction permits, finding and paying contractors, setting up utilities, and more. The regional variations in these costs should also be considered. Putting Together a Team People are key to business success. Whether you’re opening your own office abroad or evaluating contractors, here are the most important questions you’ll want to ask regarding employment rules and norms: How long does it take to employ people? When you’re hiring someone who will have to quit their current job before they can start working for you, it helps to know how long you’ll have to wait. Resignation notice norms and expectations vary by country, from two weeks in the US to two months or more in some European countries. Norms for contractors may be different—in Georgia no notice is required. What are the rules about layoffs? No company hires workers with the expectation of layoffs, but it’s smart to be aware of the rules before the possibility develops. In some cases, the time required before you can let a person go may depend less on the law than on the employment contract terms negotiated between the parties. A contract might include a clause that requires the employer to give notice at least two weeks or one month before the official dismissal. It’s also worth looking into severance obligations as some countries have laws about minimum severance for laid-off employees. You may have more flexibility with contractors in many countries, however. Are there paid leave requirements? When you’re considering global expansion, it’s important to remember that many countries require employers to offer a minimum number of paid days off for permanent employees—which will represent a direct cost for your company. These days may include public holidays, vacation, sick leave, and parental leave. Some countries, like the United States, don’t require businesses to offer paid time off for any reason, including parental leave, but some US states do. And in many US industries, paid time off is customary regardless of the law. Extended paid parental leave—up to two years—is common in many other countries, such as Mexico and the Czech Republic, but with a lower cost of living and lower relative wages in many of these nations, this requirement may not overly burden the bottom line. In my experience, contractors aren’t eligible for paid leave anywhere, though of course you should make sure of this in any countries you’re considering. How much are wages? In general, more developed countries have a higher cost of living and higher salaries. Some businesses may find that offshoring can offer savings—allowing them to hire workers at a competitive rate for their region, while still saving money on what that same labor would cost in their home country. Many countries enforce a minimum hourly wage. According to a 2022 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) minimum wage report (the latest numbers available), Australia has the highest minimum hourly wage in the world—approximately $14.50 in US dollars. The United States ranks No. 13, with a minimum hourly wage of $7.25. Some countries, including Georgia, have no minimum hourly wage requirement. Top 10 Minimum Hourly Wages Around the World (in USD)1Australia$14.502Luxembourg$13.903New Zealand$13.304United Kingdom$11.505France$11.406Canada$11.207Germany$11.108Ireland$11.109Belgium$10.9010Netherlands$10.50 Of course, for many jobs, it’s customary and competitive to offer higher-than-minimum wages to employees, so it’s important to understand the norms for your industry in a particular country. According to a different 2022 OECD report, US wages average out to about $77,500 per year, while Mexico’s average yearly wage is just $16,685. One company I work with is a used-car reseller, based in Los Angeles. It contracts with a 60-person office here in Georgia, and the full cost of operating that office is about $50,000 a month. Operations would cost at least three times as much in California, but this way the company gets the talent it needs, at a price that makes sense for its bottom line. What other employee benefits are expected? Make sure your benefits package is competitive with the packages offered by companies native to the country you’re targeting. Remember, you’re competing with local businesses. Consider pension savings, health insurance, free or subsidized lunches, stock options, and more. Again, contractors may not typically receive all of these benefits, so be sure to factor that into your planning. Understanding Taxes Calculating the cost of taxes is crucial, as different countries have different approaches to taxes and significantly different tax rates. I always suggest that business owners hire a consultant who has operated in the target country for a while and knows the written law, common practices, and lesser-known exemptions. Having a local tax expert monitoring your operations will ensure that you’re always in compliance and can also help save your company money. These are some specific tax issues to consider. Corporate Income Tax Corporate income tax is payable on profits generated by the company. Note that the difference between two countries might lie not only in the tax rate but also in the way the tax is calculated. For example, in the 62 countries that have signed the Estonian tax convention, including the US, Georgia, Italy, and Japan, companies don’t pay any tax on profits unless they distribute them. So if you run back-office operations in another country, you might decide to reinvest any profit from that entity back into the business at 0% tax. Personal Income Tax In many countries, personal income tax is calculated and paid by individuals; in others, personal income tax is withheld by the employer. In either case, what matters to employees is what they net after taxes. Hence, the personal income tax is, in a way, a shared burden for individuals and corporations. The higher the rate, the higher its negative effect on the corporation’s bottom line. Income tax costs can vary depending on the type of employees your company hires, as contract employees may be taxed differently. In Georgia, the income tax rate for permanent employees is 20% and the tax is withheld. However, contractors in certain industries may qualify for tax reductions and pay only 1% in taxes. That can make contractors in Georgia much less expensive to hire than permanent employees. Tax Exemptions It’s crucial to know how to save on unnecessary taxes. Many countries offer tax breaks for certain industries, products, types of employees, and more. This is one reason it’s so important to work with a local expert, as only then can you accurately calculate the ROI of establishing a presence in that country. Professional Standards Some professions are regulated and required to follow certain standards—and it’s important to make sure the professional standards in a country you’re considering offshoring to are as strict as the ones you set within your company. For example, many Western pharmaceutical companies have begun to partner with Chinese labs for drug development now that China has revamped its regulatory system. Alternatively, it may be easier to offshore only those activities that typically don’t require extensive scrutiny, such as IT, marketing functions, legal support, and customer service. You can even offshore certain financial functions such as internal financial reporting, financial planning and analysis, financial management, and investor presentations. However, not all financial activities can be offshored safely—particularly tax accounting and external financial reporting. Likewise, activities that must meet certain safety standards may not be feasible to offshore. Political Climate Unfortunately, there are still many active political and armed conflicts in the world, and the proximity of such conflicts may impact business operations. For example, in addition to dealing with the Russian occupation of part of its territory, Georgia has seen an influx of Russian citizens leaving their home country in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine war. This has resulted in more available freelance talent, which may benefit companies looking to expand into Georgia, but it has also caused the local currency to strengthen and real estate prices to rise, which may reduce the cost savings to businesses. And of course, the associated political tension is also potentially concerning to businesses, which tend to value stability. Social Factors When opening an office or working closely with overseas contractors, you need to ensure that your new colleagues are prepared to succeed at your company—and that your company is equally prepared to manage them effectively. Here are three significant cultural aspects to consider: Language Before selecting a location for expansion, be sure you can hire enough local employees who speak the language you use to conduct business. On a recent trip to India, I asked people there why they thought India had become such a successful hub for IT and customer support offshoring. Everyone agreed that widespread English fluency was the key. Education Education is another important factor to consider. Make sure there are enough people with the skills and/or certifications you need available in your new location. Work Culture Finally, culture matters when it comes to integrating your overseas team. In some countries, it’s customary to have strictly professional relationships and meetings, while in others it’s expected that employers and employees will get to know one another better and “spread the bread,” a Georgian phrase that means sharing a meal together. Know what your potential hires will expect, and make sure it aligns with your own corporate culture. Parting Advice: Invest in Integrating Your Overseas Team To my clients setting up operations overseas, I always suggest hiring a dedicated person who will be responsible for making sure the operations run smoothly. As a business owner, you want to know that remote teams feel included and share the same goals and values as those working at headquarters. One company I work with was established in Tbilisi to provide back-office support to a large Los Angeles brand, with more than 150 employees providing IT support, database management, customer services, and photo editing services. For the first six months of the relationship, a US-based representative traveled to Tbilisi once a month to make sure the back-office support team was aligned with the company’s key priorities and mission. After that, top management in Georgia was ready to take over fully, and the company was able to benefit from the full value of its overseas team. Expanding overseas can seem daunting at first, and the list of things to consider is always longer than you expect, but despite the initial effort and investment, the payoff can be significant over the long term. Using this guide as a starting point, you may well discover that global expansion is the key to unlocking financial savings and growing increased business resilience.

Both options allow companies to pay workers a competitive wage where they live while potentially lowering overall personnel costs. What are the risks of global expansion?Risks such as unexpected exchange rate fluctuations, geopolitical tensions, and even cultural differences can undercut the benefits. Companies must also be careful not to offshore business activities that require close local supervision or deep local knowledge, such as external financial reporting. What is an example of global expansion?Global expansion can take many different forms. A business may contract with an overseas call center for customer support, or a company may relocate its IT department to a country with a lower cost of living. Many business functions can be offshored this way, including marketing, data analytics, and internal financial reporting.

Read MoreExpertiseCFOFinancial ModelingCertified Public AccountingPrevious RoleInterim CFOPREVIOUSLY ATShareShare You’re about to start a business in the US. You have a great idea and a winning team. You’ve thought through your business plan. You’re ready to make it official—but before you can begin, you have to decide what kind of business entity makes the most sense for your new company. There are several types of business entities and the one you choose determines how your business is regulated and taxed. Your choice of entity fundamentally boils down to a few key considerations: How profits are taxed The complexity and cost of setting up the business, as well as ongoing governance and administration Liability protection, particularly of an owner’s personal assets While in some cases the choice can be obvious, it isn’t always. Each entity type offers a unique blend of legal and tax implications, and figuring out what’s right for a specific business can be complicated. With more than 20 years of experience in accounting—including more than 14 years of providing CFO services to companies across multiple industries—I have advised numerous C corporations, S corporations, LLCs, and partnerships on tax and entity-choice matters. In this article, I’ll present the crucial points to keep in mind when you need to make this decision. Note: This is a top-level guide and certain details may not apply to your specific business. Any final decisions should be made with the help of a tax or legal advisor. Understanding the Different Types of Business Entities The IRS recognizes four main types of business entities: proprietorship, partnership, S corporation, and C corporation. These types have major differences when it comes to taxes, setup costs, administrative costs, and legal protections, but any of them can be formed as an LLC for liability assurance, then taxed as if they were one of the entity types recognized by the IRS. Before we dive into the business entity types or discuss LLCs, however, it’s important to understand pass-through entities. What Are Pass-through Entities? Proprietorships, partnerships, and S corporations are all pass-through entities. They are called that because their taxable income “passes through” to the personal tax returns of the owners and is taxed there. S corporations and partnerships do file company tax returns, but these returns simply display the company’s taxable income and allocate that income to the owners on a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065). Each owner’s Schedule K-1 amount is then reported and taxed on their personal tax return—Form 1040—as well as on any state and local returns that may apply. In contrast, sole proprietorships don’t file a business tax return at all. The business income is calculated directly on Schedule C, Schedule E, or Schedule F of the owner’s personal Form 1040. Pass-through status is significant because the owners of a pass-through entity pay personal income tax on the profits of the company, but they can then withdraw those profits as tax-free dividends from the company. This is not true of C corporations, which not only pay their own income tax but also hold taxable dividends. Essentially, the C corporation pays tax on its income first, and the remaining money is distributed to the stockholders, who pay personal income tax on it. This is referred to as double taxation. Example: Taxation of S Corporation vs. C Corporation EarningsS CorporationC CorporationTaxable income$1,000,000$1,000,000Corporate tax rateN/A21.0%Top individual tax rate37.0%N/ATax owed by corporation$0$210,000Tax owed by owner$370,000$0After-tax cash remaining$630,000$790,000Tax rate on distribution to owner0.0%23.8%Additional tax owed on dividend distribution$0$188,020Net after-tax cash remaining$630,000$601,980 Note: This simplified example assumes a taxpayer who is in the highest income brackets for all earning types. It also assumes the S corporation earnings don’t qualify for the Section 199 qualified business income deduction. If they did, the scenario would favor the S corporation even more. At a large company, the double taxation problem that a C corporation faces is mitigated by this entity’s other benefits, such as the low tax rate on corporate profits and unlimited shareholder allowance. For most small to midsize businesses, though, the cons of a C corporation will generally outweigh the pros. Now that we’ve established that key distinction between S and C corporations, let’s look at the different entities in greater depth. What Are Sole Proprietorships? Fundamentally, sole proprietorships are intended for simple businesses owned by one person or a married couple. Such businesses are typically freelance businesses, consultancies, small service businesses, food stands, etc. Sole proprietorships don’t have shares or ownership units, meaning that the only exit option is to sell the assets of the company. Sole proprietorships are by far the simplest business structure. A bona fide business that starts without formally incorporating is, by default, a sole proprietorship or partnership (depending on the number of owners). Sole proprietors with no employees don’t even need to register with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The owner can simply use their Social Security number as the business tax ID. Some points to be aware of: Business expenses are deductible. Contrary to popular belief, there’s generally no need to “incorporate” to deduct business expenses. Even an unincorporated sole proprietorship is eligible to deduct its business expenses. Proprietors pay personal income tax on profits. Proprietors cannot pay themselves wages. They simply withdraw company profits as needed. Each year they owe personal income tax on the entire taxable profits of the business, regardless of whether they have withdrawn the profits or not. Profits are subject to FICA tax and federal income tax. As of 2023, FICA tax (which pays for Social Security and Medicare) is 15.3% of income up to the Social Security limit of $160,200 and 2.9% of income earned beyond that. There is also the additional Medicare tax of 0.9% that applies after self-employment earnings exceed $200,000 for single taxpayers. In my experience, many small sole proprietors end up owing more FICA tax than federal income tax, but this depends on individual circumstances. Pros and Cons of Sole ProprietorshipsPros ✔️ Cons ❌ Very easy to set upAll profits subject to FICA taxEasy for most owners to understandOwner’s personal assets are not protected, unless company is formed as an LLCSeparate business tax return not requiredNo payroll to run if there are no employees What Are Partnerships? A partnership is essentially the multi-owner version of a sole proprietorship. Most states require very little (if any) paperwork to form and maintain a partnership. This circumstance alone is the reason many relatively simple, early-stage businesses that have yet to achieve significant profitability are organized as partnerships, rather than formal corporations. The arrangement can be especially attractive for small companies without employees, in which the owners do most of the work. Partnerships are also commonly used for real estate holding companies (because rental income is not subject to FICA tax regardless of entity type) and certain professional service firms, such as accounting firms. Even though paperwork requirements for a partnership are minimal, multi-owner companies are by nature more complicated than sole proprietorships, so it is extremely important to have a partnership operating agreement that controls the operations and ownership of the company. Here are the major financial considerations you will need to plan for as well: Profits don’t have to be divided equally. Unique to partnerships, the business income doesn’t need to be allocated proportionate to ownership. This flexibility can be helpful when there is a silent partner who contributes most of the initial capital but isn’t expecting a commensurate share of the profits. Any such arrangement must be clearly laid out in a partnership agreement. Partnership income is generally subject to FICA tax. As with sole proprietorships, a major downside of partnerships is that the entire taxable income of a partnership is generally subject to FICA tax. This is a key reason most larger, highly profitable companies aren’t partnerships—the tax burden simply becomes too high. Payments to partners are not wages. Part of the simplicity of a partnership is that partners do not receive wages, but rather guaranteed payments for their services. The partnership doesn’t need to run payroll or file payroll reports if there are no non-owner employees. This can save the partnership the significant cost and hassle of payroll services and associated fees. Depending on the size of the company, the savings here may help to offset the increased FICA tax burden and make the partnership arrangement more enticing. Pros and Cons of PartnershipsPros ✔️ Cons ❌ Easy to set up and administerProfits generally subject to FICA taxEasy for most owners to understandOwners’ personal assets are not protected, unless company is formed as a limited partnership or LLCFlexible profit allocation allowedNopayroll to run if there are no employees other than partners What Are S Corporations? As companies become more profitable, proprietorships and partnerships tend to be less suitable due to how they’re taxed. Enter S corporations, a popular entity choice for small and midsize privately held companies. Although both partnerships and S corporations are pass-through entities, the latter are typically favored by larger businesses because of FICA tax. S corporation owners are required to pay themselves a reasonable wage (subject to FICA tax), but the remaining business profits are subject only to income tax, not FICA tax. Consider a business that makes $1,000,000 per year. Let’s say the owner receives compensation of $100,000 and the remaining $900,000 is business profit. The chart below shows how moving from partnership to S corporation status would save the owner approximately $31,000 per year in FICA tax, all else being equal. FICA Tax on Total Earnings/Owner CompensationPartnershipS CorporationTaxable income before owner compensation$1,000,000$1,000,000Owner wagesN/A$100,000Owner’s guaranteed payments$100,000N/ARemaining business-taxable income$900,000$900,000FICA tax on owner wages$0$15,300FICA tax on owner’s guaranteed payments$15,300$0FICA tax on remaining taxable income$31,346$0Total FICA tax owed$46,646$15,300 Note 1: These calculations don’t consider the effect of the 0.9% additional Medicare tax that would generally apply to partnership earnings above a certain income threshold, causing S corporation status to be even more attractive. Note 2: Calculations are based on 2023 FICA tax thresholds. While this benefit seems striking, for a very small company it may not be worthwhile. The requirement to pay a reasonable wage means even a “solopreneur” with no employees must run payroll and file payroll tax reports with the IRS (and the state, if applicable). The added administrative burden and cost of handling this and managing other requirements make this a disadvantage compared to partnerships and sole proprietorships. S corporations are also generally subject to stricter rules than the other entity types. For example: Generally, only individual US residents and citizens can own an interest in an S corporation. Some exceptions exist for certain trusts and estates to be allowed as stockholders. Profits and distributions must be allocated according to ownership. Loss utilization can be limited. In some cases, an owner of an S corporation that has losses may not be able to deduct that loss on their personal tax return. The loss would have to be carried forward to a future year. Only one class of stock is allowed. There can only be voting and nonvoting shares—no others. There is a maximum of 100 stockholders for S corporations. The legal conditions for setting up and maintaining S corporations usually require the help of a lawyer and/or accountant, which increases the associated costs. Despite these potential drawbacks, the FICA tax savings are hard to beat, accounting for the popularity of S corporations. S corporations also shield the owners’ assets from liability in the event of legal claims—something proprietorships and partnerships do not do. Also, by forming an LLC that elects to be taxed as an S corporation, you can avoid some of the rigid legal requirements. In some cases, a partnership can be more tax-efficient than an S corporation, even after factoring in FICA tax. In this scenario, the partners forgo paying themselves guaranteed payments and instead treat all payouts as distributions. There are significant caveats to adopting this approach—you need to work with a tax expert to see if it’s right for you—but it’s common enough that I would be remiss if I didn’t mention it. Pros and Cons of S CorporationsPros ✔️ Cons ❌ Earnings beyond wages not subject to FICA taxFull legal setup requiredCorporate legal shield functionSometimes difficult for owners to understandRigid profit allocation and distribution rulesLimited deductibility of lossesOnly a person (not an entity) can own sharesMaximum of 100 stockholdersGenerally must be owned by a US citizenPayroll must be run even if there are no non-owner employeesOnly one class of stock allowed What Are C Corporations? As businesses continue to get bigger and more complex, they may outgrow the S corporation structure. If the number of investors exceeds the 100 stockholder limit (as with a publicly held company), or if different share class structures are required, then it’s time to consider the C corporation. All large American publicly traded corporations are C corporations. Privately held C corporations are rare and typically utilize the structure for reasons other than income tax concerns. High-growth startups seeking series funding often utilize the C corporation structure. These private companies are forced to go this route because their target investors may be entities or foreign individuals, neither of which are allowed to invest in an S corporation. While US companies may register in any state or territory, it’s common for C corporations to choose Delaware as its well-defined and court-tested corporate regulations have made it the state of choice for incorporation. According to the State of Delaware, more than 68% of Fortune 500 companies are domiciled there. One significant drawback of the C corporation structure is the double taxation issue we looked at in our discussion of pass-through entities—the company pays tax on the income, and then stockholders pay tax on their dividends. Furthermore, C corporation losses cannot be deducted against stockholders’ other personal income. The combination of these pitfalls discourages many private firms from adopting this structure. In short, the idea of using the C corporation structure for tax optimization has merit in specific situations. For most small to midsize businesses, though, the cons will generally outweigh the pros. Pros and Cons of C CorporationsPros ✔️ Cons ❌ Low tax rate on corporate profitsFull legal setup requiredCorporate legal shield functionDouble taxation of corporate profitsUnlimited stockholders allowedLimited deductibility of lossesStockholders may include such entities as trusts and fundsPotential for tax-free sale of stock upon exit Now that you have a sense of the characteristics of the four main business entity types recognized for tax purposes, let’s look at whether becoming an LLC makes sense for your company. What Are Limited Liability Companies (LLCs)? As the name suggests, a limited liability company is a business structure that offers “limited liability” to owners of the company and informs the world that the owner is not personally liable for claims. An LLC is a legal entity only and is not recognized by the IRS as a taxpaying business structure. For tax purposes, if the owner decides to form the company as an LLC they must also decide whether it’s going to be a C corporation, S corporation, partnership, or proprietorship. It’s completely acceptable to organize as any of the four business entity types we’ve discussed without being an LLC. Why, then, does it seem like almost all new companies are formed as LLCs? The LLC structure helps shield the owner’s personal assets from a lawsuit against the business. In other words, without an LLC, a sole proprietor or partner may be personally liable for a lawsuit or judgment that exceeds the business assets. That event would subject the owner’s personal assets to potential claims. Compared to traditional S or C corporations, an LLC structure is generally simpler to administer. Corporations are often required to hold annual meetings and keep records of meeting minutes; an LLC is generally not subject to these regulations, even when it’s taxed as a corporation. Starting out as an LLC gives a company flexibility for a later entity change. While a company can change its entity type without being an LLC, the simplified regulations and management of an LLC create less friction for conversion. For example, a common path is to form an LLC taxed as a partnership, then elect S corporation status after the company becomes profitable. LLCs and business entities are formed at the state level. Accordingly, the exact process for setting up a new company varies by state, and may entail various fees. Corporate governance and reporting requirements can vary slightly by state as well. What does not vary is federal tax law. Each entity type is subject to specific federal tax laws that apply to all US companies of that type, regardless of the state it is registered in. Partnership, Proprietorship, C Corp, S Corp: In Review Again, the three main considerations when choosing a business entity are how profits are taxed, administrative cost and complexity, and liability. From a tax standpoint, the S corporation may be optimal, since it offers a single layer of taxation (unlike C corporations) and earnings are not subject to FICA tax (unlike partnerships and proprietorships). Sole proprietorships are ideal when you’re considering the cost and complexity of setup and maintenance. They are by far the least complicated and have the lowest cost of setup and ongoing governance and administration. But for a multi-owner company formed as an LLC, a partnership is sometimes preferable for flexibility. Finally, from a liability standpoint, the LLC structure is hard to beat. It offers liability protection along with any of the four entity structures. A non-LLC S corp or C corp can also offer solid protections from a liability perspective.

To help you understand the thought process behind choosing an entity type, I’m going to use four fictional companies to explore how different entity types can be beneficial depending on how a business is constructed and what the stakeholders want. 1. A Summer Side Hustle Joe’s Mowing Joe is a 21-year-old college student looking for additional income. He has decided to start a small lawn care business. Joe is planning to purchase equipment worth $5,000 and is hoping to turn a profit of $15,000 for the summer. Joe’s Mowing will have no employees other than Joe. Which Entity Type Is Right for Joe’s Mowing? As a young entrepreneur with a short-term business plan, Joe is a perfect candidate for a sole proprietorship. An S corporation would require significant cost to set up, and he would have to pay himself a reasonable wage (subject to FICA tax). His wage would likely wipe out his $15,000 profit, which would negate any FICA savings. Plus the hassle of running payroll would not be worth it. An LLC umbrella would add liability protection if Joe felt he needed that. 2. A Family-owned Apartment Complex LBD Group Lucia, Ben, and Dorcas are siblings who own equal percentages of an apartment complex. Lucia is a silent investor; Ben and Dorcas manage and maintain the property. Lucia has agreed that she does not need to receive an equal share of the profits, because she is contributing nothing but capital to the project. Which Entity Type Is Right for LBD Group? An LLC taxed as a partnership would clearly be the best option for LBD Group. Since rental income is not subject to FICA tax, the S corporation advantage doesn’t apply. Partnerships allow profits to be distributed unequally to owners, which is a goal of this group. There are no non-owner employees, which means no payroll would be required if the entity were a partnership. And given the liability issues in the real estate business, an LLC would offer protection to the owners in the case of a lawsuit. 3. A Married Couple’s Fledgling Family Business Brilliant Ideas Brilliant Ideas is a new copywriting business founded by Bill and Malia. Its first short tax year, including only the months since the company’s founding in June, is going to end with a net loss of $10,000. However, the couple believes next year will be profitable to the tune of $250,000. Which Entity Type Is Right for Brilliant Ideas? With losses this year, and an anticipated $250,000 in profit next year, Bill and Malia appear to be perfect candidates for forming an LLC and electing to be taxed as a proprietorship or spousal partnership this year, then electing S corporation status next year. That way they can use this year’s business losses to offset wages or other income. Next year they will draw wages from the S corporation, and the remaining profits will not be subject to FICA tax. 4. A Fintech Startup Run by Several Entrepreneurs FreeBooks Led by a small team of entrepreneurs, FreeBooks is an early-stage fintech startup. The founders are seeking private equity investors. The goal is to be on the market within a year and be a relevant player within three years, with several capital infusions along the way. Which Entity Type Is Right for FreeBooks? As a classic technology startup hoping to receive venture capital or private equity funding, it has little option other than to be a C corporation. The other types of entities wouldn’t allow the complex share class and ownership structures these types of companies require. The only other structure to consider would be to form first as an LLC taxed as a partnership or S corporation, then switch to C corp status when the corporate investors become a reality. In this scenario, structuring the company as an LLC would be greatly beneficial as it would allow more flexibility for these entity changes, keep things simple early on, and allow early investors to deduct losses on their personal tax returns. Changing Your Entity Type to Fit Future Needs Starting your company is exciting, but it’s also a time to be cautious and make sure you’re doing things right. Before you choose an entity type, reach out to your tax advisor for direction on your specific situation. While difficult, it is possible to change your company’s legal structure and business entity type further down the line as your needs and profitability change. For example, if you’re starting a traditional business (service, manufacturing, retail, etc.) with co-owners and employees, consider an LLC taxed as a partnership to start, then elect S corporation status when it gets relatively profitable. That provides the flexibility of a partnership upfront and avoids FICA tax on profits once revenue starts flowing. Just keep in mind that switching can have tax implications and result in a sizable administrative burden. Ensure that you do enough due diligence to correctly weigh all the pros and cons of the different options for your company. Getting your entity type right from the start will put your company on a sound footing to achieve its potential.

C corps pay income tax on their corporate tax returns, and stockholders must generally pay income tax on any dividends they receive. C corps permit a wider range of stockholder types than S corps, giving them greater flexibility when seeking investors. S corp income flows to stockholders and is taxed on their personal tax returns. Dividends paid to S corp stockholders are not taxable. Is a C corp better than an S corp?Many privately held companies are organized as S corps so that their owners can avoid the double taxation of C corps. However, S corps have strict stockholder eligibility rules, making the C corp structure more attractive to large companies seeking institutional or foreign investors. Is an S corp suitable for small businesses?S corp status is suited to profitable startups that meet certain requirements, especially if these startups don’t fit the C corp specs. If your business is a simple small business that is not expected to earn much more than a reasonable wage for you as the owner, you may wish to consider forming an LLC taxed as a proprietorship, as the benefits of S corp status (if any) likely will not exceed the cost of processing payroll for yourself and filing a separate business tax return.

Read MoreExpertiseFundraisingFinancial ModelingPrevious RoleInterim CFOPREVIOUSLY ATShareShareWhen it comes to financial modeling, presentation matters. A financial model is more than just a spreadsheet full of numbers; it’s a powerful tool that tells the story of your business, outlining its potential and demonstrating its viability. When you’re pitching to investors, your startup’s financial model can help you communicate your company’s value proposition, navigate negotiations, and secure the funding you need to grow. With venture capital now significantly more scarce than it was in 2021, a strong financial model is all the more important. According to Crunchbase, not even the rush to fund AI startups in the second quarter of 2023 was enough to pull global VC out of the doldrums. As a startup consultant, I aid my clients in M&A advisory, fundraising strategy, pitch presentations, financial modeling, valuation analysis, and more. I have witnessed firsthand the challenges startup founders face when they don’t follow one simple rule: Consider your financial models from an investor’s perspective. Money is key: After the fundraising ask, investors care most about a company’s financials. With investors paying such close attention to a company’s financials, you may be tempted—especially if you don’t have a great deal of financial experience yourself—to turn to a professionally designed financial model template for startups. But I don’t recommend this because, in most cases, a template isn’t as plug-and-play as it seems. You could find yourself stuck with large blank areas that don’t apply to your company’s business model, or, even worse, parts of the model that you can’t use because you are unable to tweak the embedded formulas the way you need to. Although it’s additional work on the front end, you’ll get a more useful and professional-looking result if you start from scratch. In this article, I discuss how I have helped founders build a financial model with investors in mind—and how to use the model to create a persuasive pitch. Focus on Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) In your financial modeling, it’s important to strike the right balance between including enough information to provide a comprehensive picture of your startup’s financial health, and not overwhelming investors with excessive detail. Zoom in on the most important metrics, known as key performance indicators (KPIs), which demonstrate your startup’s progress and potential. This can seem obvious at the strategic level, but startup founders often get mired in detail. I once worked with a startup that had developed an innovative e-commerce platform. It was preparing to pitch to investors for its next funding round, and had built a financial model so overwhelmingly detailed that the primary KPIs were difficult to find. I helped the founders identify and prioritize their startup’s most important KPIs and incorporated them into the financial model. Here’s how to approach getting the balance right: Understand Your Business and Industry Start by developing a deep understanding of your business model, your industry, and the factors that drive growth and profitability. This knowledge will help you pinpoint the specific metrics that investors are likely to focus on when evaluating your startup’s potential. For example, a software as a service (SaaS) startup might prioritize metrics like monthly recurring revenue (MRR) and customer acquisition cost (CAC), while a retail business might focus on metrics like average transaction value and inventory turnover. In the case of the e-commerce startup, we determined that metrics for customer acquisition cost, lifetime value, and monthly average users would need to be prominent. Align KPIs With Strategic Goals Make sure you highlight the KPIs that most clearly reflect your startup’s overall strategic objectives and growth plan. For example, if your primary goal is to rapidly expand your customer base, you might prioritize KPIs such as the number of new customers, customer acquisition cost, and customer lifetime value. If your goal is to improve operational efficiency, you might focus on KPIs related to cost control, such as gross margin and operating expenses as a percentage of revenue. The aforementioned e-commerce startup I worked with knew how much money it needed to make in sales to break even, but not how that translated to the type and number of customers it needed. We created a dashboard that tracked the number of customers for each sales channel to ensure the startup stayed on target. Make KPIs Clear and Prominent Ensure that your chosen KPIs are easy for investors to find and understand within your financial model. Consider creating a dedicated KPI dashboard or tab that presents these metrics in a visually appealing and easy-to-read format, using charts, graphs, and tables where appropriate. You can also include KPIs within your financial statements or in a separate analysis section. Wherever they are, always be certain that they’re clearly labeled and easy to interpret. I helped the e-commerce startup create a dedicated dashboard that highlighted its key metrics, making it much easier for the investors to see the startup’s performance and potential at a glance. In the end, the company was able to secure its desired funding. The investors specifically mentioned how the clear presentation of KPIs helped them understand the business better and gave them the confidence to invest. Integrate Your Cap Table An equally essential step to demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of your startup’s financial and ownership structures is to incorporate the capitalization (or “cap”) table into your financial model presentation. The cap table serves as a snapshot of your startup’s ownership, detailing the following components: Founder equity: Ownership percentages held by each founder, reflecting their roles and contributions to the startup Investor equity: Shares owned by angel investors, venture capitalists, and other financial backers, along with their respective investment rounds Employee equity: Stock options and grants allocated to employees as part of their compensation packages Convertible securities: Convertible notes or SAFE agreements, specifying the conversion terms and potential dilution effects Dilution scenarios: Potential outcomes of future fundraising rounds, demonstrating your startup’s potential growth and the impact on current stakeholders Ensuring consistency between your financial model and the cap table provides investors with a cohesive and accurate picture. Create a Sense of Urgency A robust financial model can help you emphasize any opportunities and market trends that present unique windows for your startup’s growth—if investors act fast. You can demonstrate urgency by highlighting a number of important factors: Time-sensitive opportunities: I once worked with an innovative company that developed a groundbreaking AI healthcare solution. It used its financial model to highlight the potential for substantial revenue from a new government initiative in telehealth with a limited application window. Consequences of inaction: A tech firm has developed a new IoT device for smart homes that is unique, but there are competitors on the horizon. Investors would be able to tell from the financial model that delays in funding could rapidly compromise the company’s projected market share. Speed to market: A food tech venture with a lean business model and established partnerships might use its financial model to show how quickly it could generate revenue after receiving funding. Early-mover advantage: A fintech startup that is first in its niche could leverage its financial model to show the potential for increased market share and brand recognition with investor support. Scalability and growth potential: A SaaS firm with an impressive growth strategy might use its financial model to highlight its scalable business model, demonstrating how monthly recurring revenue could skyrocket with increased investment. Highlighting time-sensitive opportunities can help persuade investors that acting fast is essential for a stronger market position and higher returns—especially useful today, when capital is much less available than it was a few years ago, and investors are increasingly cautious. The pandemic-era fundraising boom seems to be over. With less venture capital flowing, startups will need to work harder to impress investors. Format Your Financial Model for Clarity and Impact Now that you know what you need to include, it’s time to sit down and build your model. Thoroughness is important, of course, but don’t underestimate the power of smart design too. A good financial model should be as easy to navigate as a well-organized filing cabinet. Here’s how to do it: Separate each major component of your financial data into its own tab. The must-have tabs usually include assumptions, income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements. There may also be tabs for scenario planning and your cap table. Avoid clutter: You don’t need a separate tab for every view or analysis. Use a single tab for each statement or topic, and simply tweak variables to toggle between relevant views. Differentiate your content: Use prominent headings and subheadings to divide sections. Use bold text for headings, different font colors for assumptions, inputs, and outputs, and italics for comments or notes. If you need to, use lines and background colors to further differentiate tables, dashboards, and other chunks of information. Be consistent: Apply consistent formatting and styling throughout. That means all headers should look the same, all subheads should look the same, all inputs should look the same, all outputs should look the same, etc. This will go a long way toward making your model’s hierarchies and equivalencies easier to understand. Develop visual aids to present your model: Create clear and concise charts, graphs, or tables that represent key aspects of your financial model. These data visualizations can help investors quickly grasp the most important information and make your presentation more engaging. Presentation may seem like a superficial aspect of your model, compared to your actual idea, but I can’t overemphasize how much impact it can have. Let’s consider a real-life example, a SaaS company that I once helped. Its product was great—a financial management and payments tool targeted at SMBs— and its pitch deck was impressive. Its financial model, however, was like a kitchen where you couldn’t tell the ingredients from the cooked food; the investors told the founders that their model made it impossible for them to see the company’s financial potential. I saw that the company needed someone to step in and help clean up its “kitchen.” I applied consistent formatting to differentiate between the inputs and the outputs, and to make each tab easier to navigate. Immediately, it was much easier for the founders to manage their own numbers and for the investors to understand the company’s potential. As a result, the SaaS startup secured the funding it needed. Test Your Financial Model—and Never Stop Testing It A robust, well-tested financial model demonstrates your understanding of the business and increases your credibility. To ensure your model is accurate, reliable, and effectively communicates your startup’s potential, consider this advice: Double-check assumptions, inputs, and calculations: Make sure all the assumptions and inputs in your financial model are based on solid data and market research. Check that your calculations are accurate and logically derived from your inputs. Use industry benchmarks or historical data to validate your assumptions and provide a foundation for your projections. Stress-test your model: Conduct sensitivity analyses by changing key variables and assumptions in your model to see how the outcomes are affected. This helps you understand the potential risks and uncertainties associated with your business, and prepares you to address investor concerns or questions about different scenarios. Seek feedback from trusted experts: Share your financial model with experienced professionals, such as advisors, mentors, or peers who have successfully navigated the fundraising process. They can help you identify any weaknesses, inconsistencies, or areas for improvement. Revisit and update your model regularly: As your business evolves, so should your financial model. Regularly update your model with new data, market research, and any changes in your business strategy. This not only ensures that your model remains accurate but also demonstrates your ongoing commitment to understanding and managing your startup’s financial health. Be Prepared to Answer Questions and Defend Your Assumptions In my experience, investors—especially for early-stage companies—prioritize two things: whether the numbers are reasonable, and whether the founder actually understands how their business works. To effectively address inquiries and instill confidence, you must know every aspect of your model inside and out so you can explain and defend your assumptions, calculations, and financial projections in detail. Here’s how to prepare: Understand your assumptions: It may seem obvious, but you’ll need to be able to explain to investors where your assumptions come from—for example, industry research may reveal trends or cycles you can expect to replicate. Explain your methodology: How exactly did you arrive at your numbers? Transparency and willingness to share your process reassures investors and builds credibility. Do your research: Your investors likely know more about your industry than you do. Use reputable sources relevant to your field to show that your assumptions are based on information your investors can and do trust. Anticipate common questions: Prepare for likely inquiries about your model and practice your responses. For example, if you have a SaaS company, you should be ready to answer questions about how you manage your churn rate, how you plan to scale customer support, and other relevant questions. Time and time again, I’ve seen how much a simple model refresh can change the game for a startup struggling to break through to investors. A well-formatted financial model ensures that investors can quickly grasp key insights and see the potential in your startup. A poorly formatted model, on the other hand, can create confusion, which undermines the story you’re trying to tell. Just as important, a model that is well-organized and customized to your business makes it easier for you, as the founder, to read and use. A financial model is the foundation upon which you will build your company. It’s what you will use to make virtually every decision that affects your company’s future: tracking your progress, testing your ideas, allocating resources, seeking funding, analyzing risk, and projecting your growth. Imagine how damaging it would be to make a decision based on unclear, inaccurate, or incomplete information, simply because your model was too confusing. Not every founder is a nuts-and-bolts finance expert—and you don’t have to be. With expert design and routine tending, your startup’s financial model can make it easier to run your company and increase your chances of securing the investment you need to grow your business and achieve lasting success.

Read MoreExpertiseStartup ConsultingFundraisingPrevious RoleFounding PartnerPREVIOUSLY ATShareShare Companies have been debating the merits of remote work since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Those pointing out remote work’s downsides say it offers potentially fewer opportunities to build the cohesive teams and company culture necessary for innovation. Proponents of remote work like me note its clear benefits for employers as well as workers, including increased productivity, access to expanded talent pools, and substantial financial savings. In this article, I demonstrate how choosing to go remote not only reduces your startup’s overhead, but can preserve significant equity in the long run. I’ve consulted on financial and growth strategies for hundreds of founders and startup CFOs around the world and have seen firsthand how the decision between an in-office and an all-remote model can make or break a business. While startups with an on-site work model typically do plan for the immediate costs of a physical office, they don’t always look deeply enough into the implications. Spending additional dollars now to rent or build an office requires raising those additional dollars—and that means relinquishing more equity to investors when you exit. That exit may seem far off now, but as your company grows in value, the true cost of any given expense today extends well beyond its initial price tag. In this article, I present a simple, data-based framework for venture-funded companies to assess the full financial implications of building a remote company versus a company with a traditional physical footprint. You can apply this structure at every stage of the fundraising process to help you make fully informed decisions. Forecast Your Office Space Expense While every business is different, guides to starting an on-site business typically point to office space as one of the chief costs, after staff, and rightly so. The first step in deciding whether to build your company as an on-site or remote operation is to model the full impact of buying, leasing, or renting space. Anticipate Your Team Size To know how much office space you’ll need, begin by estimating the size of your team over time. You should already have a specific hiring plan for at least the next 12 months, or, better yet, for the period covered by the funding round that you’re raising money for or have recently completed (typically 18 to 24 months). Have each of your team leads provide their staffing requirements for the time frame you’re working with, based on their different departmental targets. Your business development and sales lead can tell you how many deals each team member is expected to close per month and how many people would be needed to reach this target. Your technology lead can provide you with information such as the number of IT staffers required per 1,000 active users and the frequency and scale of new features launched, and so forth. These figures, in tandem with your company’s growth targets, will help you build a hiring plan that will allow you to achieve your objectives before your next funding round. Calculate Average Revenue per Team Member Next, anticipate how many people your company will need in the years immediately following this hiring plan for your first one to two years or whatever period you’re using. To do so, you divide your revenue targets by the average revenue per team member for startups by stage. Dividing your company’s annual run rate (ARR) forecast by the ARR per full-time equivalent (FTE) in your industry allows you to predict the size of your team over the later years in your model. This step is analytically simple and grounds your assumptions in real data on revenue per person. Various sources offer data on the average revenue per team member companies should expect to generate at different stages of company growth in different sectors. For my example, I’ve used SaaS Capital’s benchmark for ARR per FTE for 1,500 venture-funded SaaS companies as of 2022, but you should use whatever source works best for your industry. Annual Run Rate (US$ Millions)ARR per FTE< $1 $25,750$1-$3 $59,108$3-$5 $92,327$5-$10$107,143$10-$20 $128,961> $20 $170,950 Additionally, you may want to adjust these dollar amounts based on your assessment of how your revenue model compares to other companies similar to yours. For example, one of my clients increased the ARR per FTEs by 15% after validating a particularly strong pricing level. But while optimism is crucial in a founder, I advise always erring on the side of caution when making assumptions that involve your fundraising needs. Estimate How Much Space Each Worker Needs and What It Costs Once you’ve forecast the growth of your team over time, search out data on the average square footage of office space needed per employee in your sector—a robotics or biotech company, for example, will require more space than a SaaS one. Then look at the average rent per square foot of office space in the city or cities where you’re considering office space. As with expected revenue per team member, this data can be found in many sources. For this example, I’m drawing on workspace by sector estimates from “Workplace Standards Benchmarking,” a landmark report by global architecture, design, and planning firm Gensler, and office space prices in different US metro areas in mid-2023 from CommercialEdge, a commercial real estate management platform. I’ve excerpted some representative data in the following two tables. Average Square Feet of Office Space Needed per Person, by Sector SectorSquare Foot per PersonTechnology115-155Biotechnology and Science125-410Engineering150-185 Average Asking Rent for Office Space in Five US Metro Areas, June 2023 CityRent per Square FootChicago$27.40Atlanta$30.68Philadelphia$30.92Seattle$38.68Boston$48.28 Given the wide range of costs across cities, this exercise may also help you with location selection, should you decide that you prefer a traditional office. With this information, estimate your total rent cost with this calculation: Team Size * Ft² per Person * Rent per Ft² = Total Cost of Rent Annually Bear in mind that, while your team may expand on a monthly basis, your ability to adjust how much space you rent will most likely occur annually or at other, probably longer, intervals, depending on your lease. Evaluate How Your Office Expense Impacts Equity Now that we’ve discussed the actual cost implications of having a remote team versus an on-site one, let’s explore the impact on equity, and what that means for a company’s fundraising needs. For these purposes, I am using Pitchbook’s 2022 trends on venture funding. The data for pre-money valuations is available at different percentiles, as is the mean (Pitchbook calls it the average) value for each. I’ll use the median values (the midpoint of the data set), since the mean values are skewed upward by outlier mega-rounds. Median Pre-money Valuations for US Venture Rounds by Funding Stage Funding StageValuation (US$ Millions)Angel$4.94Seed$10.50Early-stage VC$50.00Late-stage VC$67.31 With this data I use a simple linear forecast model to calculate the financial and fundraising trajectory of an on-site company with an initial founding team of 10 people, assuming the following: The company ARR grows at a linear rate from zero at inception to $100 million by the time of the late-stage VC round. The team size is calculated based on the SaaS capital ARR per FTE benchmarks. The amount of office space needed is updated in January of each year, based on the number of team members at the time. The company needs 135 square feet per person (the midpoint for technology teams per the Gensler report). The annual rent per square foot is $30, the effective price for several of the major cities listed above. The company holds an angel round at inception and each subsequent round at 18-month intervals, through a late-stage VC round for a total of four funding rounds. There’s an exit after five years at a $300 million valuation. Modeling these assumptions across the expected five years until exit yields $8.9 million in total rent expenses. Of course, the company doesn’t need to come up with that total upfront. Chances are, however, that leaders will decide it’s prudent to incorporate rent costs into fundraising asks. If a company does finance this expense as part of the venture capital rounds, the shares sold to cover rent will reach a value of $69.5 million upon exit. Funding Round 1Funding Round 2Funding Round 3Funding Round 4ExitMonths 1-1819-3637-5455-72ARR $0$33,333,333$66,666,667$100,000,000Team Members10150393591Rent Expense Included in Round$118,125$1,304,100$3,097,238$4,344,638% of Company Sold for Rent Expenses in Round2%11%6%6%Value That Equity Sold for Rent Expenses Will Have Upon Exit$5,512,687$29,317,885$16,438,384$18,189,908Total Rent Funded by Investors$8,864,100Total Value of Equity Sold to Cover Rent Expenses$69,458,863Effective Multiplier7.8 The upshot—which too few startups may realize—is that while building your team on site will cost you nearly $9 million in direct expenses over the course of your fundraising journey, it will ultimately cost you nearly $70 million, should you finance this expense with venture capital, yielding an effective cost multiplier of 7.8x. As you plan your company’s future, any model you build should effectively allow you to replicate this analysis for yourself. Forecast the Impact of an Expanded Talent Pool The final factor to consider in your economic evaluation is that building a remote team opens up the talent pool beyond your geographic vicinity, which can have a substantial impact, especially if you strategically target recruitment to less expensive regions. Venture capitalists—and, indeed, everyone—should also note that a remote work model allows startups to draw more senior people earlier than might have been possible if they tapped only local talent. In my experience, this talent pool expansion has positive financial implications, in that having more senior talent earlier in your company’s life enables you to grow more quickly and achieve higher valuations on subsequent funding than you would have otherwise. An increased valuation due to more senior talent joining your company in its early stages is highly consequential, but complex to model. The most accurate approach would be to review compensation levels across different markets, predict the increased value-add these senior hires would bring, then update your financial projections and implied valuations for your next fundraising round. This is a valuable exercise, but variations from company to company make it hard to estimate a general multiplier. What I suggest instead is to derive a more general—but still data-driven—estimation by revisiting the spread of venture valuations in the Pitchbook data that I used earlier. I used median figures for that earlier analysis; now I want to explore moving above the median. Funding Stage Median Valuation (US$ Millions) Mean Valuation (US$ Millions) Average of Median and Mean Valuation (US$ Millions) Angel$4.94$13.35$9.15Seed$10.50$20.93$15.72Early-stage VC$50.00$131.99$91.00Late-stage VC$67.31$286.48$176.90 The higher your pre-money valuation at each funding round, the less equity you give up for any given amount of capital raised. Increasing the valuation at which you can raise funds effectively lowers your cost of capital, since you command a higher price for shares sold and experience less dilution for a given amount of funds raised. Assume that by widening your talent pool, you are then able to execute each funding round at a point between the median and the mean (let’s say at the average of the two) while keeping the final exit value the same. This brings the total multiplier effect for every dollar you fundraise down from 6.4x to 4x. (Note that this is the value related solely to the widening talent pool benefit, and, for simplicity’s sake, I haven’t taken into account the benefits of not fundraising for rent costs in this metric.) This is a substantial improvement in the final cost you bear through the shares you transfer to investors throughout fundraising. In the real world, of course, your expected exit value can improve as well. Looking Beyond Expenses and Making Choices There’s no one-size-fits-all, surefire way to create a startup. To find what’s right for your company, it’s crucial to assess your goals. It may be that building or acquiring a physical location is the right approach for you and your company. Robotics or biotech companies, for instance, require more dedicated space for hardware. And regulators in certain industries, such as medtech, often require an on-site presence; in some cases, enterprise partners want a physical location as well. However, if these situations don’t apply to your startup, you should undertake a thorough expense forecasting that incorporates not only the cost of an office, but also the cost of limiting your talent pool to local (and potentially very expensive) hires and the equity you will sacrifice in order to pay for it all. As best you can, model how being able to recruit and attract top talent from around the globe might increase the valuations at which you can fundraise along the way. Finally, as you build your business plan, it’s worth considering the tumultuous changes of the past few years. My prior professional focus as an economist studying market crises helped me understand how economic shocks are often the impetus for many important breakthroughs in business and technology. As the COVID-19 pandemic has shown us, a lighter and more flexible cost structure and access to a broader talent pool may make all the difference in ensuring your success.

To estimate the per-employee cost of a physical office space, you can use a publicly available estimate of how many square feet each worker needs, depending on the industry. For example, the biotech sector may require as much as 410 square feet per worker. How do you calculate and budget for true startup costs?Calculating true business startup expenses means looking at how much your immediate costs will impact the amount of equity you have to give up when you exit. Following a framework that combines current benchmark data with a forecast of how much your company will grow can help you understand the true cost of your startup. What is annual run rate in sales?The annual run rate is the amount of revenue a company should expect to generate in a year. This amount varies depending on the stage of growth the company is in.

Read MoreExpertiseFinancial AnalysisData AnalysisPREVIOUSLY ATShareShareSince it was introduced in 1985, Microsoft’s Excel has become the go-to spreadsheet program among financial professionals—and, without a doubt, it remains a powerful tool. There are plenty of reasons why it’s retained its popularity for decades. But the rise in cloud computing, especially since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the exponential growth of the amount of data businesses collect have changed the way we work, possibly forever. Today’s collaborative, cloud-based business environment is where the advantages of Google Sheets really stand out. Nonetheless, there are many finance and business professionals who are still working with Excel spreadsheets in the same way that many of us learned in the precloud era, even those who have switched to Microsoft’s cloud-based Microsoft 365. In 2016, the industrial machinery manufacturing company where I oversee financial data analytics took the significant step of moving all of its 11,000 employees to Google’s G Suite, now Google Workspace—joining the rising number of firms making the switch from Excel. Consequently, I’ve been using Google Sheets almost daily since then, becoming a self-taught expert in its functionality and innovative ways of working. I have used Google Sheets to build discounted cash-flow models for large acquisitions, to manage complex integration projects, for financial planning and analysis, and, very often, as a replacement for a whiteboard when I want to sketch something in an online meeting. In this article, I share some of the advantages of Google Sheets, highlighting the features that have dramatically improved my productivity. I also provide an introduction to Google Apps Script, a powerful tool for automating workflows and extending Google Sheets’ functionality. I don’t, however, provide a head-to-head feature matchup of Excel versus Google Sheets; functionalities change so quickly that such an analysis would become obsolete within weeks. Instead, I focus on Google Sheets’ advantages and the new ways of working that the emergence of online productivity tools have enabled. I also touch on some of the negative aspects of making the shift from Microsoft. The Advantages of Google Sheets The main advantages Google Sheets has over Excel are seamless collaborative functionality, the ability to handle extremely large projects and data sets through its integration with BigQuery, and the automation opportunities available through Google Apps Script. While Excel and others also offer these capabilities, Google has made them so intuitive and end-user-friendly that even the most change-averse finance professionals can quickly get up to speed and start seeing tangible benefits. Easy Collaboration The most immediate advantage of using Sheets is the ability to collaborate seamlessly. In the old style of working, you’d use a master file that someone had to “own,” which was (in a best case scenario) kept in a shared network folder or painstakingly emailed back and forth among users. In contrast, Sheets incorporates several modes of collaborating, ranging from the asynchronous—when collaborators work independently and mostly at different times, in the same file—to real-time simultaneous collaborative editing. With asynchronous editing, you can use the comment feature to alert people to questions or concerns and assign them tasks that they can mark complete when they finish them. Smart chips put quick information at the user’s fingertips without their having to click out of the document. For example, people chips identify the person responsible for specific tasks and provide a link to their contact information, while file and calendar event chips put context and additional materials at hand. Combined with the timeline view feature, which enables users to visualize time-associated data, smart chips make Sheets an excellent hub not only for financial analysis but also as a hub for activities and information, including all aspects of projects. Google smart chips make it easy for users to access contact information and relevant documents with one click. Editing a spreadsheet live with other colleagues is a powerful way of working. The productivity of two or three people who are all highly skilled with Google Sheets quickly building out a financial or operating model together in real time is a remarkable sight compared to the old way of working. The multiple cursors in different colors, moving across the screen at the same time to build a model, look almost like a time-lapse video of a painting being created. There’s also room for different types of participants. Not everyone needs to be able to edit a spreadsheet, for example. View- and comment-only options maintain security and data integrity while granting visibility to those who need it. Built-in Version Control If you’ve ever had the painful experience of a spreadsheet crash beyond recovery that results in hours of lost work, you might have developed the habit of saving files frequently. This is fine—if cumbersome—for one person working alone, but when multiple versions of a file begin to circulate among colleagues and someone forgets to update the file name, chaos can ensue. Google Workspace makes it possible to have just one file throughout the life of the project, thanks to its built-in version tracking. Accessible through “See version history” in the menu, this feature allows you to see all edits made to a document through a handy timeline. It also includes the name of the person who made each change. Every alteration is saved and you can “rewind” to any previous point in the file’s life, back to when it was first created. Not only that, but for any individual cell, you can select “Show edit history” and click back through each edit to see who changed it, when, and to which value. This feature is available to every Google Workspace user. Microsoft users will need either SharePoint or OneDrive to access version history for Excel. Working at Scale One of the misconceptions my colleagues and I had when we adopted Sheets was that it would be fine for small calculations—more or less like an advanced calculator—but not useful for larger models or data sets. But as it turns out, Google Sheets is just as powerful as a desktop application. As I demonstrate below, Google Sheets can capably handle large financial models, and it can connect to Google BigQuery to analyze huge data sets. For example, when you’re working on an M&A project, one of the many documents you’re likely to need is a financial model to collect all the relevant historical financial data and various forward-looking scenarios based on drivers. If you often work on M&A, then you most likely tend to start from a template that contains everything you need, such as standardized financial statements, valuation calculations, etc. The current document then grows over the course of the project to incorporate financial and tax due diligence adjustments into the historical financials, using commercial/market due diligence to support the various scenarios for financial projections. Over the course of several months, the file can grow to dozens of tabs with a complex web of links between them. Sheets not only handles the large amount of interconnected data well but, thanks to its version history feature, you’ll never again yell “Who changed the discount rate?!” when your valuation model output is unexpectedly off. Analyzing Very Large Data Sets As I mentioned, Google Sheets connects to Google BigQuery, Google Cloud’s data warehouse and analytics engine, which allows you to analyze huge data sets directly in Sheets. BigQuery can house all of your organization’s data and make it available for analytics use, whether for analysis by domain experts such as finance professionals or for advanced machine learning use cases led by a data science team. To demonstrate the power of this process, I once used the following example in a Sheets training session at work: From within Sheets, I connected to one of the public data sets in BigQuery: Chicago taxi trips. At the time, this contained 195 million rows of data. Then I created a pivot table from the full data, with the time of day and day of week on the two axes, and the number of trips as values. Finally, I applied conditional formatting, such as using red to represent peak hours, to make the patterns stand out more clearly. Google BigQuery allows Google Sheets users to connect to public data sets, such as taxi demand in Chicago, as well as house and analyze their own proprietary data. The entire process took less than two minutes. Unless you’re in the taxi business, this particular data analysis is perhaps not very useful, but it shows how quickly you can analyze large data sets using the combination of BigQuery and Sheets to effectively gain and communicate insights. To offer another example of Sheets pivot table usage, a finance professional might need to pull data from different systems into one analysis—perhaps one consolidation system holds higher-level data that needs to be reconciled against several detailed data sources. If your company makes the data available through BigQuery, you can, with just a few clicks, link each data source into one spreadsheet and put the relevant views next to each other. You can then quickly perform typical spreadsheet calculations right next to—and using data from—your BigQuery-powered pivot tables or extracts. You can also create charts and formulas using data from BigQuery data sets. If you have all of your financial data in BigQuery, you can develop analyses and reports very quickly. Connecting to External Data Sources Being able to pull data into a spreadsheet so that you can work with it is a fundamental need for financial professionals. Google Sheets offers a number of built-in formulas that do this, such as the Googlefinance formula, which lets you pull data directly from Google Finance. Although not comparable to a professional service such as Bloomberg, it’s nevertheless an excellent tool for obtaining public stock and currency information, like these closing bell prices for Alphabet stock in January 2018: The Googlefinance formula quickly extracts historical stock price information for Alphabet, Google’s parent company. There are also other, more general ways to get data from the web. The functionality to extract an HTML table or list directly from a website can, for example, be useful with financial, market, or other publicly available information that you want to retrieve and work with. Connecting to the Entire Google Workspace Google Apps Script is a powerful tool that opens almost unlimited possibilities not only to extend and automate workflows in Sheets, but also to connect it with other parts of Google Workspace. This automation tool seamlessly connects Sheets, Drive, and BigQuery operations into one workflow. I have numerous examples at work where we have used Apps Script to create a large number of copies of a template reporting spreadsheet, automatically downloaded different financial information from BigQuery into each of them, and then shared each version with different people. This ensured that various teams could see only their own sensitive data, like costs. Does Google Sheets Have Any Disadvantages? I’ve been evangelizing Google Sheets. However, not everyone is sold on its benefits yet. And I think that’s because of one of Sheets’ drawbacks: Many of its benefits depend on collaboration with others, and you’ll find that uneven adoption in your organization will place limits on how fast you can take full advantage of some of the features. Also, Google Sheets, like any software, can have its small annoyances, such as a keyboard shortcut or two that aren’t what you would expect or a feature that’s missing or doesn’t behave the way you want. In many cases, though, these annoyances are primarily a problem for users still habituated to Excel rather than a functional weakness of Google Sheets. Another problem is that Excel’s success relies on its ecosystem of plugins, many of which are not (yet) available for Google Sheets. This means that if you can’t replicate what you need with Google Apps Script, using Sheets means you may need to toggle between both applications. Enhanced Collaboration Wins Out Spreadsheets are one of the most important tools, if not the most important tool, for many finance and business professionals. They are our canvases, our notepads, and our instruments. Over the course of our careers, we spend thousands of hours using them. We need our experiences with them to be pleasant and efficient. I have seen huge productivity benefits from the collaboration features and other innovations that come with using web-based productivity applications like Google Sheets as compared to their traditional desktop counterparts. Cloud-based Microsoft 365 has become more robust in recent years, but its collaborative functionality still has not entirely caught up to today’s demands. There are also immense productivity-enhancing benefits from learning to use these tools beyond the elementary level, as I hope I have demonstrated. With trends such as increased remote collaboration and the need to analyze ever-larger data sets continuing, finding the functionalities that work for you is crucial, and the business case for evaluating Google Sheets keeps getting stronger.

Read MoreExpertiseCFOFractional CFOPREVIOUSLY ATShareShare It used to be that a chief financial officer’s primary focus was on the traditional functions of the job: monitoring cash flow and financial activities; serving as a controller and accounting expert; limiting unnecessary spending; and ensuring that financial decisions conformed to standard operating procedures. These duties are still critical, of course, but they’re increasingly becoming secondary to the strategic roles CFOs are being asked to play. As the pace of business accelerates and technology advances, the modern CFO must take a broader, more forward-thinking and growth-oriented approach to the job. The consulting firm Accenture captured this transformation in a 2022 survey, finding that typical finance chiefs now spend most of their time spearheading companywide efforts to transform and optimize business operations, with an emphasis on accelerating revenue and profit growth. It’s a new reality that I’ve seen play out among fast-growing small and medium-size healthcare firms where I’ve held a number of leadership positions. These companies not only expect you to be a functional CFO, delivering on basic accounting responsibilities, they also expect you to be a strategic CFO, working with the leadership team to explore growth opportunities and maximize profitability. So how do you develop this strategic expertise? Through trial and error, I have learned that the most effective way is to focus on your existing finance capabilities and responsibilities—those functions that are already within your purview as a CFO—and elevate them to deliver the strategic insight your company needs. In this article, I share six areas where I recommend you focus. The development of the skills I discuss can be applied broadly to growth companies and employed across a wide spectrum—by fractional CFOs working with later-stage startups, by interim CFOs in distressed situations, or even by finance chiefs employed by public companies. When it comes to expanding and bolstering your existing capabilities, I discuss the easiest areas first. The later ones, especially corporate vision, will probably consume more of your time, but I expect you’ll find that mastering them is well worth it to you and your company. I include examples to show you how I put each of these concepts into action. 1. Reporting and Forecasting Reporting and forecasting are table stakes for a finance chief. The proliferation of software as a service (SaaS) and cloud services has made it easier and cheaper to integrate powerful accounting systems across an organization. A functional CFO must ensure that everyone who needs access to these systems has been fully onboarded and is using them, while a strategic leader looks for opportunities to delve deeper into the information to surface actionable insights for the organization. I can best explain how to develop this area by sharing how I demonstrated to one company that fully onboarding a team is an essential step—even for leadership. I worked for an early-stage healthcare services company where the CEO tracked corporate financials on an Excel worksheet he saved on his desktop and updated at night and on weekends. This practice created obvious problems. First, his shadow financials were often incomplete. Second, his practice caused a disconnect that prevented the finance team from developing a routine of updating information and producing useful and timely insights for the CEO. Without this routine, the CEO was flying blind when it came to sales and profitability decision-making. When I joined, I helped the company standardize all the accounting, operational, and financial reporting templates, and the chart of accounts. The company and I then agreed on a reporting calendar for when the finance team would give the CEO and board the latest income statement, balance sheet, cash flow statement, and customer- and product-level segmentation. That report also regularly provided information on the performance of individual departments, comparing the figures for each with that department’s budget, forecast, and prior-year numbers. We didn’t stop with standardizing companywide reporting, however. We leveraged the information to recommend operational changes that would improve areas of financial underperformance. This not only freed up the CEO’s nights and weekends, but also gave us strategic insight into the company’s operations while reducing the management team’s anxiety and stress under the previous fragmented reporting system. 2. Financial Planning and Analysis The next logical step for a strategic CFO is to look for ways to apply standardized databases and quantitative skills in financial planning and analysis. FP&A is typically used to produce data-driven answers to financial and operational performance questions facing any aspect of the company. Some are routine analyses, such as comparing the current period’s performance to the prior one’s, while others are ad hoc analyses such as calculating the return on investment for a new sales enablement technology platform. A strategic CFO uses the same processes and may address some of the same questions as a functional CFO but takes a more proactive approach. When I joined a pharmaceutical manufacturer as CFO, I found that few of the company’s senior leaders knew which customer, product, or geography generated the highest growth or revenue. This became a problem when the company had to quickly increase profitability. After implementing basic reporting improvements, I conducted a comprehensive profitability analysis of the company’s multiple business and customer segments to begin to answer broader strategic questions. Using FP&A business intelligence tools like Microsoft Power BI, we pinpointed the sources of the highest growth and the greatest profits and losses. We then broke them down by product category, product SKU, customer, business unit, and geography. But we didn’t just produce a report that sat in colleagues’ inboxes. We looped in cross-functional teams to help us design, develop, and glean insights from the reports, and hosted in-depth conversations with executive leaders of each functional area about commercial and operational changes that would maximize financial performance. Within a short time, the company had a holistic understanding of which segments contributed profits. Just as important, we had complete alignment among senior leaders that we should focus on the most profitable segments. This strategy allowed us to nearly double the company’s profitability in less than a year. 3. Risk Management and Mitigation If finance leaders thought risk management was just an administrative footnote to financial oversight, then the COVID-19 pandemic and breakdowns in global supply chains upended that misconception. Today, CFOs must take a role in pushing teams across the organization to make risk assessments and regularly address questions of mitigation. At the same time, they need to see risk management through the prism of opportunity, looking for where it creates potential commercial openings. For example, from 2017 to 2020, I was responsible for a group of companies that imported critical components for medical products to China or assembled them there. The companies enjoyed cross-border, lower-cost arbitrage and consistently expanded gross margins for many years. However, when I joined, I could see operational, regulatory, and macroeconomic risks on the horizon. We engaged senior leaders in thought-provoking quarterly discussions to anticipate possible hazards so we could dedicate resources and take action to mitigate the most pressing material risks. The teams consistently highlighted the possible operational and financial risks of cross-border trade barriers disrupting critical component shipments. This proved prescient when a trade war flared up between the US and China in 2018. Because we were prepared through our risk planning, my group of companies was able to minimize supply chain disruptions by leveraging backup component sources in other parts of Asia and Europe. Integrating risk management into the company culture let us not only reduce or neutralize risks, but also limited impact on the bottom line, creating commercial opportunities for our sales and marketing teams to increase market share. We continued reliably delivering products and solutions while our competitors were still coping with disruptions. 4. Digital Transformation It’s routine for a CFO to ask department heads to do more with less. Finance chiefs can lead the way by doing so themselves, examining ways to automate back-office operations to free employees from repetitive tasks while saving time and money. Automation can also aid the finance department as it deals with the constant cycle of work spiking within tight timetables: monthly closes, urgent analysis requests, and the crunch period around mergers and acquisitions. Being perpetually short of hands and hours inevitably leads to high levels of stress. I learned how necessary this transition was firsthand. After a reorganization at a global manufacturing firm, my finance team was staffed with just two business analysts. This lean team was responsible for reporting and analyzing financial results for 25 portfolio companies every month within two business days. It simply wasn’t feasible for two people to complete this spreadsheet-based copy-and-paste project within 48 hours. Automation was the only solution. We invested a small amount into robotic process automation to handle routine reporting processes and restructured the team’s approach, helping the two analysts become experts in business intelligence and visualization programming. Using these technologies, the two were able to complete the reporting tasks in one working day. They used the time they saved to undertake analysis and work with business leaders to complement the reporting with actionable insights. Seizing on these learnings, our corporate development teams took a similar approach: They automated their monthly outreach, allowing them to contact 10 times the number of prospective acquisition targets and thus cultivate a larger partner pipeline. 5. Talent and Culture One valuable way a CFO can take a more strategic role is by becoming more directly involved in recruiting and cultivating talent. Instead of just advising HR on staffing requirements, a strategic CFO will partner with HR to create opportunities to bring high-performing financial talent into the organization. For instance, I once helped recruit a very talented executive to a small healthcare device manufacturing company that my firm owned, even though I knew we were going to sell it within the next year. We asked this person to join as the vice president of finance, stabilize the company, and successfully complete the sale—even though we didn’t have a specific role lined up for him afterward. This would have been a hard sell had we not approached this candidate with transparency, honesty, and a commitment to retaining him in a senior role. A year after the sale, we delivered on the commitment and he became CFO of our largest portfolio business. Three years later, he was promoted to be the holding company finance chief, overseeing all portfolio companies. As CFO, taking an active role in developing a high-potential finance leader meant I was contributing to the company’s long-term strategy by helping to secure an employee who could steer the company in a post-sale future. While all of this transpired in the finance department, others in different functional areas noticed and adopted similar approaches to recruiting and cultivating high-potential talent in sales, marketing, operations, and technology. 6. Strategic Planning Companies value the hard data and empirical mindset that a finance chief lends to strategic planning. The CFO can use this as an opportunity to contribute to the transformation of a company’s commercial goals or capabilities, for instance, by championing acquisitions or introducing partnerships to extend competitive advantages. I had the opportunity to put this into action while working with an emerging markets cardiovascular diagnostic company that made heart monitors. The company had aggregated terabytes of heart rhythm data through the thousands of devices it had sold. This data was a unique asset, but the company didn’t use the information for any commercial purposes. As CFO, I considered any large source of unique data as a potential opportunity in a world where SaaS business models can be commercialized quickly. I challenged the team to use that data as the basis of an analytics service while protecting patient confidentiality. After months of development with local software partners, the team unveiled a new service to hospitals to provide real-time monitoring, analysis, and alerts if the software detected abnormal rhythms in a patient. The service deepened customer relationships and added a highly profitable revenue stream. With greater visibility and deeper insights about the company, the strategic CFO develops a point of view about what products, capabilities, and M&A opportunities can create transformative value for their company. Yet it’s important to keep in mind that what truly elevates your contribution to a growth company comes down to leadership. The demand on firms to meet targets is immense, especially as macroeconomic pressures rise and venture capital, private equity, and public market expectations for financial performance continue to climb. Companies need leadership, and leaders must deliver growth. The strategic CFO is uniquely empowered in this respect. When the modern CFO rises above their functional responsibilities and provides valuable strategic insights, they can help their company transform and grow for the future.

He serves as Toptal’s Chief Economist. Read MoreExpertiseFundraisingStartup ConsultingPREVIOUSLY ATShareShare When the global economic forecast is uncertain, fundraising is just the first half of the battle for new startups. The VCs that continue to invest in new companies often demand more aggressive terms to reduce their risk. Term sheets from reputable VCs probably won’t be outright predatory, but during a recession, worst-case scenarios are more likely to occur, and founders will be more likely to pay the price. Careful cap table modeling and financial modeling can help you avoid surrendering more equity than you otherwise need to. As the co-founder of a global VC firm that has funded more than 50 startups, I have sat across the table from founders like you many times. I can tell you that VCs want you to succeed because that’s how they succeed. But a gloomy economy makes everyone a little more tight-fisted and risk averse, which means you can expect your investment to come with extra conditions you wouldn’t necessarily see in boom times. Valuation gets a lot of headlines, but preferred terms—the preferred equity that investors receive—are the part of the negotiation that can really lure you into a worse deal than you intended to make. Pricing these terms can be challenging because many of them will only become relevant only under certain circumstances. Dilution protection, for example, kicks in exclusively during a down round, so it can seem like a relatively low-risk concession in a good economy. In a volatile one, however, it can mean the difference between life or death for your company. The most accurate way to price conditional terms is to run a simulation of potential outcomes in your financial model and calculate the effect of the proposed terms on your cap table, then average those results over many iterations. However, that can require expensive specialized software and significant statistical expertise that you may not have. A far easier—yet still very reliable—option is to undertake scenario analysis with your cap table and financial modeling. In scenario analysis, you analyze distinct degrees of financial outcomes (typically low, medium, and high) rather than running a dynamic simulation that iterates on hundreds of possible outcomes. A complete overview of how best to price preferred terms is beyond the scope of this article, but I offer a roadmap for how to approach a few of the most common and consequential terms. I also show you how to value them accurately enough to avoid unintentionally giving away too much of your company. Position Yourself for Negotiation Before you sit down at the table, do some homework: Make sure your startup’s finances are in order, be sure that you understand dilution, ensure that your equity is apportioned appropriately, and have your financial model in place. These steps will prepare you to estimate your company’s valuation and build your cap table so you can model the terms your investors are proposing. Nail Down Your Valuation If you’re at the seed stage, valuation is typically a less important part of the negotiation, but you need to make a persuasive case for the numbers you put forth. This requires some creative thinking. While there are quantitative tools that speak to the financial health of a startup, at this early stage you most likely will not have sufficient cash flow data to arrive at a robust fair-value estimate. Instead, approach this matter as a triangulation exercise, using the following elements: Financial Model Even without a lot of historical data, you need a starting point, so perform a traditional discounted cash flow on your financial model with whatever information you have. Then use the standard venture target rate of return—20% to 25%—as the cost of capital to see what present-day valuation it implies. Finally, work backward to determine how much cash flow growth would be required to hit your target valuation. This will reveal the milestones you need to hit in order to develop a clear plan to achieve your target valuation, as well as demonstrate, ideally, a generous return on investment to your investors. Recent Relevant Transactions and/or Exits The conventional wisdom is to look at recent comparable transactions to validate your figures, but finding recent similar deals among direct peers or competitors is difficult, even under normal market conditions. Every startup and venture deal is different, and the publicly available information on transactions excludes important elements of the overall deal terms or structure. However, by expanding your search to recent relevant transactions—those in your general industry or technology area—you can still provide investors with persuasive context to support the multiple on your revenue and other applicable metrics. Because startup funding agreements are private, direct peers are difficult to find. A more expansive approach will help you get the data you need to support your ask. Aggregate Market Trends Pitchbook offers a considerable amount of free data on private market trends in valuation and deal size across funding stages. That data can be skewed by a small number of “mega rounds” at unusually high valuations and can hide a considerable range of outcomes. Even so, in general, showing that the implied valuation from your financial model is in line with other deals will help validate your asking price. If an investor aggressively pushes for a lower valuation, consider that a red flag. The primary concern of investors should be their return. Framing the price discussion within the larger context of the growth that you’ll achieve with this funding round—and the future valuation it will enable you to reach—can help take some of the pressure off your current valuation. I once had a startup client that was able to demonstrate so convincingly that it could expect ongoing 70% monthly growth that the question of lowering its valuation never came up. Use a Dynamic Cap Table Your financial model is central to the valuation discussion. But the true battlefield for the negotiations is your cap table, which is where you track the equity breakdown of your company. Here are three features you must include in your cap table format to model your investors’ proposed terms: Every Round of Fundraising: Include any prior seed or pre-seed investments that will convert upon Series A. Include your future rounds as well—something I see founders fail to do all the time. Typically, I assume at least a Series B prior to exit or sufficient profitability, but it’s a good idea to assume a Series C too. Investor Payout: Add a line that tallies your investor payout across rounds. This is important because if you offer a certain preferred term to your Series A lead investor, then you can typically expect your Series B lead to demand the same. If you’re not modeling the impact of your terms through the end of fundraising, those concessions can snowball. Future Fundraising Needs: As your business grows, so will your expenses—staff salary and options, physical overhead, production costs, and more. Just as you budget for those in your financial model, you’ll need to budget for them in your cap table. Cap table modeling will also help with the common question of how much money you should attempt to raise in a given round. Fundraising in smaller increments can minimize dilution, since your valuation will presumably increase over time. However, you have to weigh this potential benefit against the risk of having less money in the bank at any given moment, as well as the likelihood that you’ll have less time to focus on fundraising as your business grows. This question often intertwines with negotiations, as the attractiveness of the terms will affect how much capital you choose to accept. Your modeling may also help you decide that it might be better to walk away entirely and undertake an extension of your prior seed or pre-seed round instead, to buy you more time to grow. Prepare to Model Preferred Terms Valuation is just one piece of the puzzle. In times of capital scarcity, investors are likely to consider more aggressive preferred terms in the hopes of reducing their risk (downside protection) or increasing their potential reward (upside optionality). Here are three of the most common and impactful preferred terms that founders should, in some cases, avoid and, at the very least, model carefully before accepting. Liquidation Preference In the event of liquidity or dissolution, liquidation preference grants the investor an agreed-upon amount—usually the return of their capital (1x), plus a potential guaranteed multiple (>1x)—before you receive anything. The rest of the pie is allocated proportionally based on percent ownership. To see the impact of your investors’ proposed liquidation preference, add a line to the cap table that shows the amount that will be due upfront to your investors (and those from expected future rounds) before you receive your share. The results may demonstrate a substantial reduction in the payout that you and your team members can expect. You can use this information in the negotiation to make the case that if the investors expect to derisk their return in this way, they should accept a higher valuation. It’s a matter of principle: Risk and reward go hand in hand in investing, and contractually reducing the former should then raise the size of the latter. Dilution Protection In the event of a down round, dilution protection clauses require a startup to generate additional shares for the investor in order to maintain the investor’s relative stake. Weighted-average dilution protection, which only guarantees a certain percentage of the original stake, is a tolerable ask. Full-ratchet dilution protection, which preserves the investor’s entire stake, is a highly aggressive request, as it essentially demands all the potential reward without exposing the investor to the corresponding risk. Aggressive dilution protection raises your risk as well, as it can trigger a dilution death spiral that can ultimately kill your chances of surviving a down round. When your company becomes too diluted, that can eat up so many of the shares reserved for your team and future investors that it becomes difficult to retain and hire the best talent, as well as continue fundraising. Pushing back against full-ratchet dilution protection requires a delicate touch. I find the best way to do it is to take a Socratic approach and ask your investors enough questions about the potential downsides of their proposal that they eventually come around to your position of their own accord. First, show your investors your cap table modeling and explain the impact that that level of dilution will have on employee morale and investor appeal. Ask them how they think it’s possible for you to grow the company under such conditions without the additional capital a higher valuation would provide. In this way, you can show them how the expected dollar value of their final holdings can increase if they give a little on the percentage today. Full-ratchet dilution protection can be so damaging to a startup that I generally advise doing everything possible to avoid it—including walking away from the deal—unless your business will not survive without that investor. Even then, it’s worth trying to push back. Super Pro-rata Rights Standard pro-rata rights allow the investor to participate in subsequent rounds, up to the point of maintaining their initial ownership stake. This term can most often arise during the seed round, as many seed investors look to follow on with more capital as the stars begin rising. I typically recommend that founders preemptively offer pro-rata rights to investors, as the opportunity to follow on is part of what makes early-stage investing viable. During tight markets, however, investors sometimes request super pro-rata rights, which give them the right to invest enough to increase their percent stake in subsequent rounds. While pro-rata rights are fair, super pro-rata rights are not, as they lock in a share of the potential upside disproportionate to the size of the investor’s commitment in the current round. They are essentially the opposite side of the coin from full-ratchet dilution protection. If you are familiar with options pricing, you can model this as a call option where the strike price is your expected Series A valuation and the volatility inputs come from the scenario analysis you performed with your financial model and their respective probabilities. I don’t recommend granting super pro-rata rights under any circumstances, as that can hinder your ability to bring on additional investors in future rounds. Investors in later-stage companies typically have a minimum percentage that they’re willing to accept, and if super pro-rata rights allocate too much to your earlier investors, you can find yourself in a situation where you have too little space left in the round to close your funding gap. If an investor wants more exposure to your company, they should increase their current investment amount instead. If, however, you really can’t afford to walk away from a deal that demands super pro-rata rights, then you need to persuade the investor to give a bit more on current valuation in return for this ability to capture additional upside. Read the Contract and Get a Lawyer I cannot emphasize enough how necessary it is to hire a lawyer who specializes in venture agreements when you’re reviewing an investor contract. This is one area where you don’t want to skimp. Preferred terms are constantly evolving, and no matter how precisely we attempt to model or summarize them, the only source of truth is the legal contract. While you can negotiate the business and financial essence of the terms, do not sign anything without first showing the documentation to a lawyer to ensure that it accurately reflects what you’ve agreed upon. Sloppy and ambiguous language can be just as dangerous as a deliberate “gotcha” clause. For example, any metrics-based payout plan opens the door to havoc, even in the rare cases when the metrics are perfectly defined. Ambiguity nearly always favors the larger and better-funded party (in this case, the investor), since they can fund and withstand a dispute for longer. Hiring a highly qualified venture attorney will help you avoid this outcome. Remember the Human Factor I’ve focused on how your cap table and financial model can help you grasp certain key terms in order to understand the true worth of what you’re offering and make sure you receive sufficient consideration in return. The negotiations themselves, however, are a profoundly human exercise. Knowing the profile and point of view of the investors will help you infer how much relative value they’ll place on certain terms. Investors who are newer to VC, such as family offices and investors with more traditional private equity backgrounds in emerging ecosystems, will often focus more on downside protection, while Silicon Valley investors frequently pay more attention to upside optionality. Corporate venture capital may be more interested in strategic terms than economic ones. Understanding their priorities will help you tailor your approach. Finally, remember that just as the terms you accept will set a precedent for future rounds, the negotiation is only the beginning of your relationship with a particular investor. Your behavior during negotiations will tell the investor what kind of partner you will be—and vice versa. The moment you sign the final agreement, you’ll all be on the same team, and soon enough you’ll be preparing together for the next round.

Read MoreExpertiseBusiness PlanBusiness Operations ConsultingStrategic Planning ConsultingPREVIOUSLY ATShareShareSince 2020, a slew of disruptions has obstructed the smooth operations of companies around the world, making it difficult for many to obtain the parts they need or get their products to customers. With significant economic uncertainty likely to continue in the foreseeable future, business leaders would be wise to prepare their companies to adapt more quickly and holistically to changing conditions. Based on my extensive experience as a business planning and business operations consultant, I believe that the best way to do this is through sales and operations planning (S&OP). There are different ways to implement this collaborative methodology, but they all help companies develop a comprehensive long-term plan (12 to 18 months) that includes and aligns specific objectives for both the commercial divisions (product, sales, and customer service) and operations. I usually recommend also including finance (financial planning, budgeting, and cost management) and global strategy divisions when implementing S&OP, a method sometimes known as integrated business planning (IBP). S&OP is an iterative process, so it regularly incorporates new input from stakeholders, enabling a company to respond rapidly to changing environments. And one of the chief benefits of my approach is that it can sync supply with client demand, while simultaneously matching daily operations to business objectives. Companies that continually use new information to adapt can spot oncoming problems before they hit. For example, S&OP can alert firms that they may need to identify alternative manufacturers, vendors, or distributors to use when their regular partners can’t deliver products. A few years ago, I was working with an auto parts company in Ecuador that bought products to distribute to customers. We started having problems getting the parts from our vendors, which were based in China. But in the course of S&OP work, we had already researched backup vendors and found a parts distributor in Dubai. When obstacles appeared, we pivoted swiftly to get the products from this new source and minimized any impact on our customers. Research suggests that our experience was not unique. According to assessments of more than 170 companies by McKinsey & Company, organizations with a well-functioning IBP implementation have “service levels that are five to 20 percentage points higher, freight costs and capital intensity (total assets divided by sales) that are 10% to 15% lower, and customer delivery penalties and missed sales that are 40% to 50% lower” than those of companies without effective IBP. Firms that have optimized IBP processes are 10% to 20% more productive than firms without them, and they respond to disruptive events quickly and effectively. While S&OP is not a new process, the supply chain crisis has made it clear that too few companies are benefiting from it, either because they don’t have the right processes in place, or they aren’t using them to best effect. In this article, I share my insights about how to initiate or improve S&OP implementation so your company can weather supply chain problems and other potential disruptions, like freight or cargo container limitations, natural disasters, or IT outages. Why S&OP Optimization Is So Important Now I was introduced to S&OP more than two decades ago while setting up a manufacturing resource planning process for a cosmetics manufacturer. Back then, S&OP was a helpful way to maintain alignment on company goals and to increase productivity and reduce waste when specific problems arose that were exceptions to the norm. Today, in the aftermath of a generalized global supply chain crisis, S&OP has become a necessity for businesses that rely on multiple supply chain processes. By now, the global supply chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine conflict, skyrocketing freight shipping prices, limited shipping container supply, and other factors have mostly subsided. However, there are always unknowns on the horizon. A McKinsey Global Institute report found that companies should “expect supply chain disruptions lasting a month or longer to occur every 3.7 years” and that the accumulated losses of these events could represent 42% of one year’s profit over a 10-year period. Today’s long, complex supply chains are highly vulnerable to disruptions, including extreme weather events, terrorism, or trade disputes. That’s why S&OP is so vital. In fact, improving S&OP is the top priority for chief supply officers, according to a 2020 survey by The Hackett Group, and continues to be a key focal point for optimization. This concern is a tacit acknowledgement that simply putting a process in place isn’t enough. Poorly executed S&OP can also interfere with an organization’s ability to enlist alternate manufacturers, vendors, and distributors; identify alternative customers; or generally manage its market and demand. Companies have always been concerned about unexpected events that could make it difficult for them to get the materials they need, produce enough to meet demand, or get their products to their customers. But for today’s hyperproductive businesses, typically relying on a highly fragile global value chain, the stakes are higher than ever before. How the S&OP Process Works First, let’s examine how S&OP is designed to function. It’s a highly collaborative process that involves input from every department at every stage. Initial implementation starts with the formation of a cross-functional S&OP team that works to coordinate and finalize plans at each stage. While your team’s exact composition will vary based on your company’s size and makeup, with the IBP approach, it usually includes people from the following departments: Commercial: product, sales, and customer service managers, demand manager, and demand planners Operations: production master scheduler, supply chain planners, buyers, quality assurance specialists, and distribution managers Finance: controller, costing accountant, and financial planning manager or budgeting manager No matter who is on your S&OP team, the main steps in the process should be the same. Core Steps in the S&OP Process For proper S&OP implementation, you’ll need to accomplish—and repeat—all of these steps, but you can adapt them for your firm. For example, if one of these meetings becomes too long or complicated, you can divide it into two more-manageable ones. On the other hand, if a few meetings seem brief, you can combine them into one session. Product portfolio and forecast review: This step aims to deliver a unified corporate product strategy by analyzing the life cycle of each item in the company product portfolio. In order for the S&OP team to see an integrated review of each product or service that will go to market and be offered to customers, all departments involved in the S&OP process contribute data, like previous sales history and sales forecasts, inventory, production capacity, projected demand, and external events that could affect demand. The step also takes into account the most recent financial data, such as production costs, price, margins, holding costs, transportation costs, and so on. Since S&OP is an iterative process, after the first time through, the plan obtained in the last S&OP executive presentation is also integrated into this product review. Demand planning: The goal of this step is to ensure your company’s resources and sales goals are aligned, so that your production and supply chain can produce the inventory to meet anticipated customer demand promptly. This process uses past demand patterns and forecasts to predict need for products and services throughout the supply chain. Historical sales data, market trends, and other relevant information from the different departments are analyzed to estimate how much of a product or service will be required. Input and feedback from the operations group are especially important here so that you can define realistic demand levels according to product availability. The resulting demand plan is also analyzed and adjusted by the S&OP team to keep it aligned with strategic company goals like product line growth, discount percentage, and gross margins. Supply/operations planning: Next, the demand plan is translated into a supply plan, so that inventory and supplies are available to support the projected demand. Some of the tasks here include forecasting demand for raw materials, components, and other inputs; identifying and assessing potential suppliers; monitoring supplier performance; identifying and assessing potential risks to the supply chain (like freight limitations, supplier disruptions, or changes in market conditions), and developing plans to mitigate these risks; and making sure that the supply plan aligns with company priorities, such as inventory levels, resource utilization, fill rates, and percentage of perfect orders. Financial planning: Based on the demand and supply/operations plans, the financial team’s plan looks at the expected demand for a product or service and the related costs to estimate the company’s financial performance over a specific period. The main deliverables here are the projected P&L statement, the projected cash flow statement, and the budget compliance report. Cost is analyzed as a secondary concern. The cross-functional S&OP team reviews and discusses the plan alongside the demand and supply plans to see that the company’s financial goals are aligned with its operational goals and that the company has the resources it needs to meet demand and achieve its financial goals. Executive S&OP presentation: Next, the S&OP team presents the main points of the overarching plan to senior management to get executive input, approval, and buy-in. Typically, the team and leadership also consider “what if” scenarios to make decisions and final plan adjustments. Then the S&OP team incorporates recommendations from senior management and reviews the results before proceeding. The main deliverable of this meeting is a comprehensive, integrated plan that aligns with the company’s strategic, operational, and financial objectives. This plan will also inform the first step of the next period’s S&OP. This S&OP cycle is usually repeated monthly, allowing stakeholders to stay aligned while continually refining the long-term plan based on changes to business needs, the supply chain, or market conditions. And since the day-to-day activities of every department connect directly to the long-term plan, each one can act swiftly to address unforeseen situations. Any changes in needs or circumstances, including new or altered constraints, should be communicated immediately to the entire S&OP team. Having a long-term plan that’s revised often also helps your company reach agreements with strategic vendors and customers, increase business responsiveness, and protect margins. 5 Tips for S&OP Success Throughout my 25 years in the field, I’ve seen five implementation issues consistently impede successful S&OP. These are the best practices your business should follow in order to reap the full benefits of S&OP: Collaborate Continually Many companies see the S&OP process as linear: The commercial team presents a demand requirement, and the operations team generates enough inventory to support it. This approach won’t improve business responsiveness. Instead, you must get all participants on the multidisciplinary S&OP team to work together—not sequentially—from the start. The commercial group needs to communicate with operations while developing its demand plan so operations can start producing inventory. Likewise, operations has to talk to the finance group to determine how much inventory the company can afford to produce. This kind of interlacing collaboration isn’t a given. When I started working with the local office of a large food manufacturing and processing corporation in 2005, the company didn’t have a dedicated S&OP team or an effective process. Although the commercial department presented a monthly demand plan, operations always altered it before developing its own plan—without sharing it with commercial. So there were two different plans running in parallel. When I optimized S&OP at this company, the team I formed started doing objective historical data analysis and used the insights we gathered to correct the initial plan. The result? A unified, efficient plan that increased productivity, cut spending, and minimized losses. At last, operations was paying for the level of manufacturing that fit the commercial team’s promotional strategies—and the finance group had the cash flow to support them. Once they saw these benefits, the departments were more willing to collaborate with one another, making subsequent planning faster and easier. Bring Leadership on Board Having a CEO or general manager who’s not fully committed to the plan set by the S&OP team significantly weakens the process’s effectiveness. S&OP strives to bring and keep all departments in alignment. If a CEO isn’t aware of the process or doesn’t fully understand it and sets a different direction, subordinates will have to follow. At best, the company’s effort will be fragmented; at worst, the departments will be working at cross purposes. Yet, executives’ decision-making is often not aligned with S&OP because they consider it an optional addition, not as a system fully integrated into their day-to-day meetings and operations. When I implemented S&OP in a large cosmetics corporation in Latin America, my first move was to sit with the general manager of one of the business units to discuss the steps involved. The manager already had a monthly committee meeting with his senior staff, so he didn’t like the idea of an “extra” appointment. I suggested merging the meetings and reviewing the main business KPIs and issues along with the S&OP plan. Our first session lasted more than 10 hours. But it showed the GM the methodology’s benefits, and he approved its use for the company. He helped define the plan, agreed to manage it, and gave the team unconditional support. Over time, the executive S&OP meeting was shortened to less than three hours. Insist on Accountability At every company, an S&OP process requires both the daily execution of tasks with due dates and a transparent chain of responsibilities. Every participant must be accountable for the duties they accept. Accountability should be a given, but I’ve seen many companies neglect it. And the worst situation an S&OP team can face is realizing the plan failed because somebody didn’t complete a task. Rather than permit failures, senior management must hold all S&OP team members accountable. For that to work, responsibilities must be clearly defined. Individual assignments must be specified and tracked, and there should be repercussions for not fulfilling duties—as well as incentives for succeeding. One way to accomplish this is to tie earnings to performance. Turn Off the Noise For S&OP to function well, focus is key. In many implementations I’ve worked on, team members waste too much time reviewing historical results, often because they’re arguing and trying to justify their decisions or assigning blame for past failures. Historical results should only be points of reference for continuous improvement of the S&OP process. My general rule: Your team ought to invest one-third of its time looking at the past and two-thirds defining and analyzing its plan for the future. Another kind of noise is poor data quality or management. Examples of this include data that’s inconsistent across departments, as well as lack of clarity about data definitions and preparation. At its first meeting, your S&OP team should define, agree upon, and implement a formal methodology for obtaining, unifying, and presenting information. This way, you can quickly make decisions based on data all departments trust, helping the company pivot even in the face of an industry-changing disruption. Keep Information Flowing Companies can only react as quickly as their communication channels and practices allow. Based on my observations, businesses that responded effectively to COVID-19-related supply chain limitations gathered and moved information swiftly throughout their organizations as they made collaborative decisions. Commercial, operational, and financial departments also need solid communication processes to stay in alignment as they respond to crises. This means having meetings at least once a week and sharing updates and information daily. I saw the effects of inadequate communication at the food company I mentioned earlier. The commercial and operational departments didn’t share information consistently and didn’t follow a unified plan. Operations didn’t know the commercial team’s sales volume, so it generated too much product. Consequently, the company had unbalanced inventory levels and large volumes of product scrap due to expiration, meaning losses of close to $1 million. To tackle this issue, I developed an Excel spreadsheet that performed first-expired, first-out inventory management with a given forecast and inventory. This generated warnings that prompted operations to suggest adjustments to the estimates, letting the commercial team create promotions for at-risk products. Weekly meetings between teams strengthened this process, and the S&OP team reduced product write-offs by 80% in one year. Information like inventory levels of at-risk products can’t wait. To increase responsiveness, companies should implement not only the monthly S&OP cycle communication but also good communication practices for day-to-day functioning, which some organizations call sales and operations execution (S&OE). Optimized S&OP implementation helps your company anticipate and address problems quickly and efficiently. The long-term planning involved improves your ability to mitigate disruptions to your supply chains or other networks, while the emphasis on regular review and revision keeps business as usual a priority. And while the initial setup may require time, thought, and effort, this process will allow your company to respond adroitly to whatever comes at it. You can’t stop change—but you can be ready to meet it. Understanding the basicsWhat are the components of sales and operations planning?Since S&OP is customized to the specific needs of each company, precise steps and their order will vary. But the five core tasks that are consistent across organizations are product portfolio and forecast review, demand planning, supply/operations planning, financial planning, and the executive S&OP presentation. What are the benefits of S&OP?S&OP enables firms to respond more quickly and effectively to value chain disruptions, thus mitigating losses. It helps companies see problems in advance and identify solutions, like finding alternate vendors. S&OP also makes operations, sales, and finance functions more efficient by ensuring alignment on a unified plan. Who is responsible for the S&OP process?Everyone on the S&OP team, including personnel from the sales, operations, and finance groups, is accountable for their part of the process, and all the groups contribute data and insights. Senior management takes overall ownership, helping to define the process and then managing it while supporting all stakeholders.
