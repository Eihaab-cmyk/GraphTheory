To wear the marketing one in style, read this.Victoria Alex·FollowPublished inVIZZUELL·7 min read·Oct 10, 2023--57ListenShareInstead of introductionYou may wonder, Why “wish”?Let me explain.There are two main reasons.1. The first one is backed up by self-interest.I have studied Economics, after all. (If you don’t get the joke, go read about the “invisible hand”. I am funny.)Marketers’ lives will be way easier when more entrepreneurs embrace these truths. Here I count on all the marketers to “Share, Like, and Subscribe”. I do work for your greater good.2. It will save entrepreneurs so much hustle trying to fix mistakes that can be easily avoided.I understand not every business owner has a marketing background. It is normal. Let’s trust the universe to make them stumble across this article and help them save time and money. Ah, and headache as well.And here are my universal marketing truths:Posting on Facebook is not marketing(Neither is posting on Instagram, TikTok, or Medium… consider any other social media platform included in this example)While we are on the subject of Facebook, I will take a minute to share a few more specific examples of that channel.Facebook is one of the most mature social media platforms. Chances are when you say social media marketing, you actually mean, “I want to grow on Facebook”. It is that popular. Looks like every company has to be there. Even though the organic reach of business profile posts on the platform is around 1%.Consider this: over 300 million photos get uploaded on Facebook per day.Do you believe that a single post of yours stands a chance? Be logical.These facts alone should have discouraged you from believing that a sporadic post on social media can lead to business success. Have I managed to convince you yet? If not, give me one more try.Likes and followers won’t convert into real currency unless you have a solid strategy for how to do it. You are doomed without a strategy.A social media marketing strategy doesn’t start with a post. It starts way back with nailing down your customer’s persona.This will give you information on which social platforms this person frequents. What are their interests, and what they care about. Consider these two points:Different people use different platformsDifferent platforms call for different contentAnswer these questions:Who are the platform users vs what is your product?Do you need to be there?Are your posts backed up by research? Or are they off top of your head?Is the post part of a bigger system that can consistently generate content?Armed with all this information you can now build the whole strategy. And distribute your efforts between the platforms.Choose which forms of content would be appropriate for each platform.A staggering number of people recycle content from a platform to another without even the slightest change. If your marketing guru is doing this, fire them. Right now. Imagine me posting my Facebook post on Medium. Seriously?!The logo is not the brandThe logo is an important part of branding. But the logo is not the brand.Let me give you an AI example. I have heard AI talks are hot nowadays. Now that I have secured my views, reads, engagements, and all, here is the example.You open Fotor or something. You type in what kind of person you want to see. And…bam, you have a picture. Of a person.I need a picture of an Eastern European woman = I need a logo for a hair salon.But who is this person? How do they think? What are their values, beliefs, motives and desires? What keeps them up at night? How do they take their coffee, or maybe they don’t even drink coffee? You got the point.This person does not exist out of this picture. So does your brand, if it is only a logo.I don’t want this article to be a lesson on branding, so I will stop here. Just have it in mind. If someone offers you a logo, make sure you check with them if they can create a brand identity for you.Marketing ideally should start before there is a product…or even a companyIf you are waiting for a plateau in sales to start your marketing efforts, you are way too late.Yes, I understand, you run a small business. Sure, there are more urgent expenses. But you don’t need a million-dollar marketing campaign.What you need is to know your customers and your product. Your effort should be to enhance the product so you always delight the customer. The rest will follow.Ideally, you should hire a marketing agency from the outset. Or find a freelancer who knows their craft. So you don’t build inconsistent messages. Or even worse, start offering unsellable products.Marketers are not magicians, and not everything can be fixed. If this is the case, they may even suggest rebranding.Subscribe. You will receive an email with a friend link.Every interaction with your customer is marketingEvery customer’s touch point with your product or service, I call marketing. It can be advertising or badvertising.What I mean is that you can’t press undo. In real life and in business, this button doesn’t exist.Everything you or your employees do or don’t do …Everything your product or service is or isn’t …… is building an image of your brand in front of your customers.An employee driving a company-branded car irresponsibly — badvertisingYou not answering an email on time, or not giving a clear feedback on when an answer is to be expected — badvertisingYou arguing with customers on Google reviews — badvertisingMe writing this article with the logo of my company as the header image — hopefully advertisingThe list can go on and on. I can probably try to expand it in a separate article one day. We will see how my writing career goes.After-sales marketing is equally as essential as pre-salesI see many business owners fixating on sales. They get their sales, and then what?Are these customers going to come back? For a repeat purchase I mean, not back to complain or ask for a refund.I am sure you have heard of this. Over and over. To win a new customer costs 5–6 times more than to keep an established one. Blah blah. We all know it. And yet, why do so few companies do something about it?You can always show customers that you care about them and their experience.Even if you don’t have the budget. Just be polite by checking on them after the sale. See if everything is fine. Don’t wait for negative reviews. If you follow that advice, you may even resolve issues that no one expected you to resolve. Read: Loyalty boost.And if you are a big company with deep pockets, you have no excuse. You need to invest in retention marketing.The bigger the purchase, the more invested your customers are. Therefore they will need more reassurance that the choice was right. You need to be there and assure them your product/service was indeed the best fit. Not nice to have, but a must-have.Instead of conclusionI tried to summarize the article in a single picture.As a business owner, you don’t have to be a marketing expert. If you can’t afford to work with a marketing agency from the get-go, it is also understandable. Just make sure every action you take to promote your business has the customer in mind.Make it a habit to ask yourself:How would this affect my customer?
