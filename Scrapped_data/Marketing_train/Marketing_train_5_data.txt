Through trial and error, I discovered the “don’ts” that are crucial for a website’s success.But it wasn’t easy. I made mistakes — lots of them.Fast forward to today, I can create websites that ranks on top of search results in just a few weeks.🚀 In fact, I catapulted my recent blog from obscurity to 50,000 daily visitors in 30 days.Today, I’m pulling back the curtain to reveal the 15 critical blunders I made and how you can dodge these blogging landmines.Let’s get started.1. Ignoring Audience ResearchI had decent writing skills when I started blogging, and through some online videos, I learnt that I should target keywords that have less competition.Thus I started writing around those less competitive keywords without any second thoughts.Big mistake 🙅🏻‍♂️It was like shooting in the dark, creating content without a clear understanding of my audience.It wasn’t until I started researching my audience’s interests and needs that I began to see engagement and traffic spike. Remember, your content needs to resonate with your readers even when using less competitive keywords.2. Overlooking SEO BasicsSEO seemed complex, so I ignored it. But only when I got the hang of basic SEO practices like keyword research and on-page optimisation, my organic traffic soared.It’s true that your content solely have the power to make your blog a hit, but you can’t expect that to happen if people don’t even find it in the first place.🧧 Free Resource: I have a step by step SEO checklist that I give to my students, you can get it for free - Get Ultimate SEO Checklist for free.Remember that SEO is not optional; it’s fundamental.3. Underestimating the Power of HeadlinesYour headline is the first, and possibly only, impression you make on a prospective reader.I learned that compelling, curiosity inducing headlines increased my click-through rates dramatically.Moreover, out of the 21 actionable things you can do to improve your CTR, 9 are directly related to having an optimised title. Check out yourself.4. Not Optimising for Mobile UsersI underestimated the mobile audience. Once I optimised my blog for mobile, I saw a significant uptick in traffic.Mobile optimisation is no longer optional; it’s essential.Make sure your website is well optimised for mobile users or you can simple pick themes that perform great even on mobiles.You can ask me in comments 💬 if you are unsure which Wordpress theme you should use.5. Not Updating Old ContentWould you believe if I told you that I used to update each of my blog posts every 2–3 days?Well not ‘every’ blog post, but I made sure I updated my well performing blogs almost every third day!This not only boosted their SEO but also provided continuous value to my readers.From Google’s POV; old content can become outdated and irrelevant. So keep your content fresh and up-to-date.6. Failing to Optimise Site Speed and PerformanceSlow site speed equals lost visitors and drop in search rankings. This is not news for most of you I know, but still I bet most of my readers have overlooked their site’s speed and performance.I learned optimising my site’s performance was non-negotiable for retaining readers and improving search rankings. Fast loading times keep readers happy and engaged.✨ Instant Tip: You must have LightSpeed (or any other plugin) installed and properly set up with your website.7. Poor Content StructureUnorganised content is a reader’s nightmare. Clear, concise, and well-structured content keeps readers engaged. Breaking up text with headings, bullets, and images works wonders for readability.But do you know that search engines also love organised content?8. Not Using Analytics to Guide Content StrategyData is your friend. Once I started using analytics to understand what content worked, I could tailor my strategy to what my audience wanted more of.This insight is crucial for growth.Your Google search console dashboard is your greatest ally when creating content. It gives you the best keywords and content ideas that even tools like SEMrush and Ahrefs can’t.How?I will dissect into this step-by-step in my next story, make sure to subscribe to my email list. 🥳9. Overlooking User Experience and DesignA clunky website design can drive visitors away. Improving my site’s design and user experience led to longer visits and lower bounce rates.Your website should be as enjoyable as your content.10. Skipping the Use of Categories and TagsIn the beginning, my blog was a maze. Properly categorising and tagging posts simplified navigation, enhancing user experience and SEO. It’s like organising a library — it must be easy to navigate.You can also use breadcrumbs to make navigation even easier. Using breadcrumbs in your website can benefit user experience and SEO.Breadcrumbs are these small navigation handles on top of your website’s page (You can easily deploy these using free plugins)👇11. Limited Use of Visuals and MultimediaText only posts can be dull.Incorporating visuals and multimedia not only made my content more engaging but also more shareable. Diverse media formats can significantly enrich user experience.12. Inconsistent Posting ScheduleIn the early days, my posting schedule was all over the place. Consistency is key.When I started posting regularly, my audience knew when to expect new content, which significantly boosted engagement.13. Neglecting Email List BuildingLike most of the new bloggers, I didn’t prioritise building my email list from day one, a decision I later regretted.Your email list is a direct link to your audience, making it an invaluable asset for driving traffic and building relationships.✨ Instant Tip: You can install plugins to help you collect & build an email list easily.14. Avoiding Networking with Other BloggersBlogging is not a solo journey. Collaborating with fellow bloggers opened up opportunities for guest posts, backlinks, and shared audiences.Networking is a game-changer.15. Limited Experimentation with Different Writing StylesI played it safe with a singular writing style, which was a missed opportunity.Experimenting with various styles — from formal to conversational — can resonate with a wider audience and keep content fresh.☄️ Quick Question: What do you think about my writing style? Tell me in comments.Ending notes;Each of these mistakes was a learning opportunity that helped me grow my blog to 50K daily visitors.I hope you can leapfrog these common pitfalls and fast-track your way to blogging success.What’s next?In my upcoming story, I will share one of my keyword research strategies that exactly tells me if my website will rank for these keywords or not.I promise these upcoming weeks will be a long collection of insights that will truly help you achieve results with your website and your brand!🧧 If you want me to help you in SEO, leave me an email from my bio.Until then, keep experimenting, keep learning, and keep growing!Peace out, AyushSEOSeo TipsBloggingWebsite TrafficMarketing----59FollowWritten by Ayush Tanwal2.3K Followers🌟 I help Startups Grow | Free SEO Checklist: growthvox.club/subscribe | Founder @ RankShark | Connect 📧 luckktanwal@gmail.com | Marketer for largest Ed-TechsFollowHelpStatusAboutCareersBlogPrivacyTermsText to speechTeams
