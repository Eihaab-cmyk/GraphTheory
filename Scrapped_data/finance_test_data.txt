Read MoreExpertiseData AnalysisBanking ConsultingPREVIOUSLY ATShareShareDigital banking is less expensive for financial institutions than maintaining brick-and-mortar locations, and legacy banks have been shrinking retail branch networks in the US for more than a decade. The COVID-19 pandemic shuttered even more in-person services and accelerated the shift toward digital banking, which lets customers access accounts, products, and services through a website or mobile app. Digital banking has grown steadily, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the trend is expected to continue. Enhancing customer experience by leveraging deeper, more granular data analytics will most likely accelerate this growth. Not surprisingly, banks have been spending more than ever on technology, and improving customer experience and service delivery is their highest priority. However, financial institutions haven’t been reaping the maximum return on their digital investment because of increased spending on contact centers to deal with mounting customer concerns. A 2020 survey from the management consulting firm Capital Performance Group found that, from the end of 2019 to December 2020, online banking activity—including transactions and other interactions—increased as much as 30% and mobile banking activity surged as much as 80%. But it also revealed that contact center volumes had as much as doubled at some institutions and continued to be elevated. And a 2021 survey conducted by Cornerstone Advisors showed that customers are calling their banks more frequently because they can’t find answers online, or their financial institutions don’t provide the virtual support needed to solve problems. These statistics highlight the unfortunate truth that many of the digital products and services banks have been offering for years—from payment systems like Zelle to authentication—still fail to meet customer expectations, often because using them doesn’t feel intuitive enough. Even worse, Zelle in particular has been plagued by issues related to disputes, especially those concerning fraud, unauthorized transactions, and accidentally excessive fund transfers. As a consultant at several of the largest commercial banks in the United States, I’ve seen the difficulties of digital transformation firsthand. Banks have vast troves of information that could help them develop strategies to drive customer retention and activation, but the data is underused. Most institutions’ data analytics usage isn’t nearly robust enough to capture the depth and breadth of information about customer behavior required to understand users’ needs and how best to meet them. Support teams typically use extremely small sample sizes when they’re recording and listening to calls for quality assurance—1% or less at one bank I worked with. As a consequence, extrapolating the findings can yield misleading results. To truly address these problems, banks need to develop more detailed, holistic customer data analytics on a much larger scale—including all calls. Then they have to use the patterns of behavior they find to inform the creation and enhancement of digital functionality that satisfies customers’ needs. In this article, I’ll walk you through the steps I take to help banks do this. Establish a Strategy Team The first step to increase consumer adoption of digital banking and enhance customer satisfaction is to establish an in-house team composed of the bank’s analysts and product experts that will have access to data collected across all channels and products. This team is essential because there’s too much data for one individual to aggregate, study, and draw conclusions from. This group must also actively collaborate with department heads to ensure its findings can be implemented at the enterprise customer level. I recommend that this team be subdivided into smaller cross-functional groups for each product. In my work with commercial banks, I’d tell each of these teams how many customer calls it could eliminate by implementing certain features or functions, so it could prioritize its work accordingly. To calculate this reduction potential, I used a proprietary customer journey analytics platform we’d developed to dissect the user flow and friction points. (Tealeaf and Google Analytics are similar tools that you can use for the same purpose.) Identify Categories of Data and Set Your Goals The second step is to determine and obtain access to the disparate sources of data across all platforms and functions. At a typical legacy bank, data sources can be broken into two categories and multiple subcategories. For example, the teams I set up at banks used these: Products and businesses Retail, such as checking and savings accounts Credit cards Mortgages Automotive finance Wealth management Points of contact Contact center telephone calls Contact center interactive voice response (IVR) communications In-person interactions at retail branches ATM interactions Desktop application Mobile application Outbound notifications/alerts Much of my analytical work was delving into call statistics at contact centers, and I consider this the most important area to focus on. It’s where the overwhelming majority of support requests are made: Banks generally don’t take email inquiries for customer service anymore because it's too costly, even when done offshore. Chat has replaced email but accounts for only a small portion of all customer service interactions among top banks—less than 5% at the institutions where I consulted. Additionally, because of the high volume of requests, live agent calls are significantly costly for banks. So this is the area I’ll focus on as I explain my process. Once data sources are identified and accessed, the financial institution can begin establishing key measurable objectives to help frame the project’s scope, which can set the stage for its problem-solving strategy. Here are the objectives we established at the banks where I consulted: Improve customer experience—measured by Net Promoter Score (NPS), a key indicator of customer satisfaction that assesses peoples’ likelihood of recommending a company—across all channels Increase digital adoption and engagement Reduce calls to contact centers when they aren’t adding much or any value Reduce low-margin, basic banking interactions at branches Improve efficiencies across service operations while reducing risks As expected, the data showed that the dominant channel in terms of the volume of customer interactions is digital. Surprisingly, though, at the banks where I worked, highly active digital customers were more prone to seek support than less active digital and traditional banking users. Digital banking resulted in more than twice as many calls and inquiries into contact centers as traditional banking. Understand Why Customers Are Calling Once data categories and goals are identified, the team needs to consider what kinds of queries into the bank’s data will help it assess the nature and circumstances of the customer support requests. At the banks where I consulted, we focused on the contact centers, specifically information from customers’ interactions with phone agents within a given time period, and came up with the following questions: How many customers spoke with a live agent? Who were these callers, i.e., what were their profiles in terms of service interactions across channels, transactional activities across products, and customer value at the enterprise level? What percentage of those callers were digitally active? What, if any, banking activities had occurred before the call? If there had been a banking activity prior to the call, in which channel did it take place? What did the customers call about? Did any of them call more than once? If so, how many times? How long did the calls last? For customers who made multiple calls, how much time elapsed between them? While banks typically do track the number of calls fielded by contact centers, they usually don’t delve into many of these ancillary statistics. This is consistent with what I’ve seen more broadly in financial services: Firms track events but do a poor job of measuring activities around events that can explain behavior and help them make improvements. Knowing that a customer spent 20 minutes attempting to resolve a dispute or activate cash-back rewards before they called would give call center employees helpful context and inform their interactions. At the banks where I consulted, I worked with the strategy teams I built to help the institutions document each call’s purpose through a system of record. For example, we could see that one customer, whose identity was anonymized, had gone online minutes before calling and tried unsuccessfully to close their account—the experience that had prompted the call. Then we assigned each call a label denoting its purpose and a time stamp. We were also able to determine secondary and tertiary reasons for the calls by identifying events that had occurred around the primary catalyst, allowing us to map out a full picture. We subsequently calculated a key metric known as call-to-contact spread, which we used to assess the experience of the overall population of callers. It also served as a benchmark for improving efficiency. Call rate: the total number of calls made, expressed as a percentage of the entire customer base Contact rate: the number of customers who made calls, also expressed as a percentage of all customers Call-to-contact spread: the call rate minus the contact rate Our first goal was to reduce both the call rates and contact rates, because they were trending higher than the industry benchmarks for top banks, which usually run around 20% and 10%, respectively, for a given month, based on my experience and reports from third-party benchmarking firms like Finalta from McKinsey. Second, we wanted to make the two metrics equal, meaning that we had eliminated repeat calls. Once we’d accomplished that, we’d be able to say that we had achieved first call resolution, meaning consumers only needed to make one call to get their problems solved—a key benchmark in customer relationship management. The other related metrics we analyzed and hoped to decrease included: Call durations Call transfers Escalations Complaints Most contact centers use the call reasons acquired from customer relations management systems or call recordings, but very few use the system of record to drive improvements on these metrics. The upstream conditions in the system of record can eliminate some calls altogether and, in other cases, help match callers with the right call agents, based on their activities before the call, their customer profiles, and the levels of service needed. Most financial institutions employ customer experience management software that surveys people after interactions, producing a Net Promoter Score. At the banks I worked with, we set (and accomplished) a goal of increasing the contact centers’ scores to 55%. Analyze Call Patterns to Create Profiles The next step involves analyzing call patterns using various systems of recorded data points to figure out what’s driving customers to call. The comprehensive customer-level data sets we used where I was consulting included: Monetary transactions, such as large point of sale (POS) fees as well as payments and reversals. Non-monetary transactions, such as address changes, cards being declined, and disputes. Channel interaction events, like phone calls, IVR communications, desktop activity, mobile activity, branch visits, ATM transactions, and outbound alerts. Customer profile/segmentation, such as tenure, high-value flag (indicating a high level of engagement), and number of authorized users. Customers’ active vs. inactive product holding, i.e., the number of products each customer has and whether they’re using them, which indicates the likelihood that they’ll interact with the bank for service. (Note: We focused on active customers to measure contact and call rates.) From these categories, we captured some key and easily accessible data elements to better understand the following: Channel containment: customer propensity to stay within a channel for short periods of time, generally 15 to 20 minutes Channel self-service activity: what the customer did to self-serve, through digital, ATM, or IVR Channel mode or preference: the primary channel that the customer used After analyzing these upstream conditions, we focused on the downstream effects by measuring and analyzing what was going on with live agent calls. Excluding calls that lasted less than 60 seconds, we examined call patterns and types, calculating time ranges, identifying how calls were made, and determining whatever drivers we could. We also collated the data so we could see the channels where customers had been banking. After applying more advanced analytics and measuring time between calls, we grouped the population into segments: Cluster callers: These were customers experiencing issues who could not self-serve, needed human help with multiple interactions, and placed a high number of calls within a short time period. (We defined this as two or more calls within 24 hours.) Scattered callers: These transaction-driven callers made a lower number of calls than the cluster group, at a regular cadence and with similar types of inquiries. Scattered callers placed three or more calls across six months with an average time between calls of more than 48 hours and a coefficient of variation of average time between calls greater than 100%. Random callers: This segment was composed of information-seeking customers characterized by an irregular volume of calls with different types of inquiries. Address Callers’ Needs by Group Once call pattern analysis is complete, it’s time to parse the data further by group. At the banks where I worked, this task revealed interesting and potentially actionable insights. At one of them, for example, the analytics showed that 5% of the population were cluster callers, 30% were scattered, and the remaining were random. The cluster population was primarily digital, while the scattered exhibited less digital activity, with a portion being habitual or heavy callers. This table highlights a 12-month view of the live agent caller population taken at the end of the three-year buildup around this effort: A breakdown of customers who contacted service agents during the final 12 months of a three-year unpublished study I conducted at one of the institutions I worked with. This analysis enabled the bank to implement changes that increased customers’ digital activity and NPS while decreasing contact and call rates. The cluster population, while small in number, has a big effect on NPS and complaints. We followed these findings by producing a series of insights with recommended strategies to meet key objectives, starting with the cluster group. Here’s a breakdown of the issues that were found to be driving calls: Password/username authentication Fraud/unauthorized transaction Zelle payment Undelivered outbound alerts Overdraft/insufficient funds fee Based on our enhanced understanding of callers’ motivations, the first step we took to reduce cluster callers was to recommend specific ways to improve the online experience and contain customers within the digital channel they preferred. I also worked with the customer experience team to better design targeted surveys to assess pain points and issue resolution, and we tapped a queue of fully empowered phone agents to handle this group. These agents could waive fees or penalties, whereas others could only refer callers to more senior representatives. For a high proportion of the cluster population, one bank had incorrect email addresses on file, which prompted a wider look that showed incorrect email addresses for more than 10% of all digitally active customers. A campaign was rolled out via push notifications and secure emails to prompt customers to confirm and change these addresses. Scattered callers were driven more by routine services like payments, deposits, and cash withdrawals, and less by digital activities like Zelle fund transfers. Their channel preference was phone, and almost 10% of them were labeled as heavy or habitual. The strategy for this group was targeted messaging and guidance toward digital adoption and engagement. Many random callers were inquiring about new features, products, and hours of operation for particular branches. Some of this information was added to the online experience to reduce calls. At the height of the pandemic, customers had to make appointments to go to branches. The call centers at one of the banks where I consulted were fielding thousands of calls to set these up, so I worked with the digital team to enable customers to make appointments online, eliminating many calls and saving money. By grouping callers into three buckets, we were able to establish a call pattern effort that helped the banks I worked with better understand the drivers of behavior and how different channels were being used, especially digital versus phone. This strategy was central to cutting contact center expenses, which were increasing even as the customer base remained flat. It also aimed to improve customer experience and service levels while minimizing wait times, transfers, escalations, and callbacks. The results from one bank in particular were profound after three years. Digitally active rate increased by 10% Contact rate decreased by 12% Call rate decreased by 15% NPS increased by 5% The drop in contact and call rates also reduced several key risk factors. In identifying calls that didn’t add value to the bank, we found that many live agent phone functions could instead be performed by the customers in self-service channels, which saved money and decreased the likelihood of human error around disclaimers, product changes, account openings and closures, and other services that customers inquired about. There’s no shortage of data available for analytics in banking and other financial services, and reducing contact center calls and expenses is just one example of how you can use it to drive positive transformation: You may well find another focus or use a multipronged approach. The challenge is to transform your information into insights that enhance customer experience, increase digital engagement, and save money. Fully understanding what’s working—and what’s not—can ultimately lead to nuanced changes that make the system work better for everyone. Understanding the basicsHow is data analytics used in banking?Data analytics is the study of data sets to find patterns and draw conclusions. Banks use it to assess customer engagement and satisfaction across their products and services. What is meant by digital banking?Digital banking refers to the use of financial services and products through a bank’s website or mobile app. It includes all kinds of bank-related activities, such as opening or closing an account, configuring alerts, disputing fraudulent transactions, and depositing, withdrawing, and transferring funds. Why is digital banking the future?Digital banking is theoretically less expensive for providers, and legacy banks have been slashing US retail branches for more than a decade. Properly implemented, it’s also faster and more convenient for customers. Despite its current imperfections, its use has increased year over year.

Read MoreExpertiseComplianceChartered AccountingPrevious RoleChief Operating OfficerPREVIOUSLY ATShareShare Companies today are facing tremendous pressure from current and prospective employees to provide more flexible working arrangements, and there are more options than ever before. While the abrupt shift to remote work caused by the COVID-19 pandemic was initially chaotic, working from home (WFH) has proved far more viable than most expected. Companies—and entire industries—that hadn’t previously considered adopting such policies are now looking at making them permanent in order to attract and retain employees. Now that we’ve largely overcome the cultural and technological barriers to working from home, the next logical frontier is working from anywhere (WFA). This level of freedom and flexibility was once written off as a fantasy. But now, given the backdrop of the Great Resignation and rising employee resistance to return-to-office mandates, whether or not to provide employees with the option to work from anywhere continues to be top of mind for many employers. The main barriers to working from anywhere are legal and taxation issues. Key risks include tax compliance (for employees and employers), immigration concerns, local employment laws, and data security problems. While these risks may seem daunting initially, they can be managed. Major companies, like Spotify and Revolut, already have WFA policies. Such policies don’t necessarily grant employees absolute freedom. Rather, they can be designed to provide workers with some degree of flexibility, while imposing strategic limitations to minimize risks. I’ve worked across EMEA, APAC, and the US, and have spent a significant amount of time as a globe-trotting remote worker myself. I’m a chartered accountant and have held senior roles for global multinationals, enabling me to travel to more than 150 locations. I’ve experienced firsthand the challenges of dealing with complex corporate tax, individual tax, and employment law issues across multiple jurisdictions. My family and I have found working from anywhere to be life-changing. My 5-year-old daughter has already lived in four countries and traveled to more than 20. Being able to work from anywhere has allowed us to truly immerse ourselves in different cultures and pursue our passions in ways that we never could on short vacations. This new way of working inspired me to start my own company: I now advise corporations and individuals on how to make WFA a reality. Because WFA is a new and evolving policy area that involves regulations from an enormous number of countries, there are still more questions than answers. That being said, employers are managing to move forward and make decisions despite some ambiguity. The simplest—and perhaps best—way to evaluate the risks and rewards of offering a WFA policy is through the lens of a comprehensive ROI framework. This type of analysis can help you make an informed decision as to whether adopting a WFA policy is the right choice for your organization and help you optimize a policy for your level of risk tolerance. From “Work From Home” to “Work From Anywhere” I mentioned the mounting pressure employers are facing from employees to let them work not just remotely, but increasingly from anywhere. You may ask: What exactly is the difference? WFH refers to full-time employees whose companies allow them to work remotely, usually from the comfort of their homes. WFH policies typically apply to workers who stay within one country and can choose to work from “home” either some or all of the time. WFA policies are different. They permit employees to work remotely abroad on a temporary basis, typically for more than seven days but fewer than 365. Durations within this range fall into a legal gray area in many countries. These stays are longer than standard business travel but fall short of requiring a permanent change in residency. While WFA isn’t a new concept for some (myself included), it’s something that has often slipped through regulatory cracks. However, as a growing number of people join the WFA ranks, temporary residency is likely to come under increased regulatory scrutiny and stricter enforcement. This shifting landscape is all the more reason to develop a well-designed WFA policy that protects your company from legal and tax compliance risks. WFA Policies: What Do Employers Stand to Gain? Both hard data and strong anecdotal evidence indicate that allowing employees to work remotely can provide tangible benefits to employers, helping them attract and retain top talent, increasing employee satisfaction and productivity, and reducing the need for and the cost of office space. Employers that permanently provide the option of WFA reap the additional benefit of access to the global talent pool. Software company GitLab estimates the net benefit it receives from being a fully remote company at $18,000 per worker per year. Even before the pandemic, academic research from leading universities suggested that allowing remote work could increase employee productivity. A 2013 study led by Stanford professor of economics Nicholas Bloom found that the transition from traditional office work to working from home led to a 13% increase in employee productivity. A subsequent observational study conducted by professors from Harvard University and Northeastern University found that allowing employees to move from WFH to WFA led to a further 4.4% productivity increase. The message from employees is clear and consistent: Inflexible working arrangements are one of the primary reasons they cite for leaving their jobs. In a recent survey from GoodHire, 74% of respondents said they’d require some form of remote working arrangement to stay at their current jobs. A growing body of evidence suggests that many workers would even be willing to take a pay cut for the option to work remotely on a permanent basis. While the amount varies by source, in general, most of those surveyed say they’d accept salary reductions of 5% to 10% to make remote working arrangements permanent. What Are the Downsides of WFA Policies? There are disincentives to adopting a WFA policy, chief among them the compliance nightmare that WFA can create. We’ll look at this primarily from the perspective of the employer, who generally faces greater risk exposure. However, employees who work remotely in a country other than their permanent tax residence for extended periods of time face certain risks as well. The primary risk employers face in WFA scenarios is the possibility of triggering “permanent establishment” (PE). PE describes a business’s activities in a foreign country that are substantial and ongoing, enough to give rise to tax liability in that country. Different countries and their respective tax treaties may use slightly different criteria to define PE, but most rely on guidance from Article 5 of the OECD’s Model Tax Convention. There are two principal ways that an enterprise may trigger PE: operating a fixed place of business (physical or virtual) in a country and/or compensating a dependent agent in that country (usually someone with the power to sign contracts on behalf of the company). Senior executives and salespeople are typical examples of dependent agents, though the designation varies by country and situation. For these reasons, both the nature of the work conducted in a country, as well as the length of time and degree of regularity with which that work takes place, are important factors to consider when developing your WFA policy. Let’s say a senior director in your company—someone who is responsible for major strategic decisions and who has the authority to sign contracts on behalf of the company—wants to live in their summer home abroad for seven months each year. The nature of the work being conducted, combined with the significant length of time spent in a single country and the recurring nature of the visits, will likely trigger PE by failing both the “fixed place of business” and “dependent agent” tests. If a foreign country deems your company to have a permanent establishment there, you risk incurring a considerably higher corporate tax bill. On the other hand, a junior software developer working from an Airbnb on a Caribbean island for one month per year is unlikely to trigger PE. PE carries the most financial risk when allowing employees to WFA, but it’s not the only risk. I’ve outlined the other major risks in the following table. How can you develop and optimize your company’s WFA policy in a way that maximizes the potential benefits while mitigating the most significant risks? With an ROI framework. An ROI Framework for WFA Policies In much the same way that investors calculate the return on an investment, companies often seek to estimate (or, after the fact, measure) the return on a strategic business decision relative to its cost. An ROI framework can be a helpful tool when developing a WFA policy or comparing policy options. The inputs will undoubtedly be imprecise, as it would be impossible to assign concrete numerical values to either the costs or benefits involved. Regardless, this theoretical framework can help you see how various aspects of your policy can be modified to maximize your ROI, either by increasing benefits or decreasing costs. For our purposes, the “cost” side of the equation should take into account the additional administrative expenditures of implementing a WFA policy as well as the “cost” of each of the primary risks listed in the following graphic. You can estimate the cost of any given risk by multiplying the probability of the negative outcome occurring by the cost of the penalty that would be incurred. For example, offering a WFA policy for 30 days per year poses an extremely low probability that any employee will trigger PE in a foreign country. Although the penalty cost of PE is high, the probability of incurring that cost is negligible in this scenario, so offering that policy leaves your company in a fairly safe position. Conversely, an unacceptable risk might be permitting someone in a high-risk role like sales to spend more than half the year in a country where there’s a significant risk of creating a permanent establishment that could cost the company millions. In that case, it would be hard to build a business case to allow them to work from anywhere. (In the preceding chart, the estimated cost of replacing an employee comes from Gallup, and some surveys pertaining to worker preferences were conducted by Goodhire, Owl Labs, and Vidyard.) As you develop and compare potential WFA policies, consider four key questions. The answers will directly factor into the ROI of a given policy option, allowing you to optimize your policy by maximizing the benefits and minimizing the risks. 1. Is WFA a viable option for your company? Not all jobs can be done well remotely. This may seem obvious, but it’s not always as clear cut as you might think. WFA can further complicate matters if employees are working across different time zones. However, over the course of the pandemic, many business leaders who once thought their businesses couldn’t function remotely or asynchronously discovered that in fact they could. And even industries that require fixed schedules and a physical presence—like automotive plants—may have departments (financial, legal, HR) that can operate more independently. Before you seriously consider adopting a WFA policy, ask yourself whether asynchronous remote work would be possible for your company and how likely it would be to result in lower productivity. Think about this for the business as a whole, as well as with respect to individual departments and roles. In some cases, industry-specific regulation can be a limiting factor in where employees can work. For example, certain types of financial institutions are highly regulated and may need to comply with specific licensing requirements in order to conduct business across state and country lines. In other cases, remote work may be possible, but less efficient. Asynchronous work poses certain challenges, particularly with regard to communication—however, it can also increase efficiency by letting work continue around the clock. McKinsey & Company has identified which industries are best suited for remote work. 2. How many days of WFA should you allow in a given year? The number of days you permit employees to work from anywhere per year should be a function of two factors. First, as discussed in Question 1, consider whether productivity will be negatively impacted by extended periods of remote work. For example, many jobs in the technology sector, such as software development, are relatively independent and often performed remotely. It’s hard to see how WFA for any length of time would pose problems. However, in other industries or roles that require a high degree of collaboration, a month or two out of the office from time to time may be workable, but longer time periods might not be ideal. Second, think about external regulations. Many visa and immigration rules are based on standard time periods (e.g., 30, 90, or 183 days). For example, American citizens are generally permitted to spend up to 90 days in a given country under a traditional tourist visa. It’s unlikely that carrying out remote work for a US-based company from abroad—work that doesn’t involve interaction in the local market—would pose a serious risk of triggering PE within this timeframe. It’s not a coincidence that most of the WFA policies adopted by major companies to date range from one to three months per year. Shopify employees are permitted to WFA for three months per year, Revolut offers two months of WFA, while American Express allows one month. For any given WFA policy, a shorter duration lowers the probability of several key risks: triggering PE, running afoul of immigration rules, and becoming subject to local employment law. 3. Which countries will you include or exclude? You can approach this question in one of three ways: a pre-approved roster of countries, a list of banned countries, or a combination of the two. (For geopolitical or security reasons, most companies ban at least a few countries.) As you determine which countries to include in your policy, consider which risks are particularly relevant to each location, as well as the overall level of risk. The US and UK, for example, have some of the most stringent regulations in this area: Even stays that border on 30 days have the potential to raise tax issues. In contrast, and particularly over the course of the pandemic, a number of countries have introduced policies with the explicit aim of attracting remote workers. Many countries whose economies previously relied heavily on tourism have made a calculated decision to offer remote work visa programs in order to attract relatively high-earning remote workers and the discretionary spending they bring. 4. Should you dynamically link your performance management system to your WFA policy? While most of the data suggests that expanding employee flexibility, whether by WFH or WFA, results in increased productivity, there are ways you might be able to amplify this benefit. Just as employers have historically offered performance-based bonuses or awarded paid sabbaticals to those who stayed with the company for a certain number of years, allowing employees to work from anywhere can be used as an incentive benefit linked to either performance or retention. What’s the Right WFA Policy for Your Organization? Nothing is without risk. On the one hand, adopting a WFA policy may expose your company to a host of compliance risks. On the other hand, failing to offer at least some flexibility around international remote work puts you at risk of losing some of your best talent. What’s an employer to do? My hope is that the ROI framework will provide you with a basic understanding of the potential costs and benefits of adopting a WFA policy. What’s more, it should help you compare different policy options and see how adjusting specific components of your WFA policy can impact ROI. That being said, some of the risk areas are complex. They vary by country and are constantly evolving as regulators attempt to adapt to an increasingly geomobile global workforce. While this basic framework can help you develop a relatively low-risk WFA policy for your company, if you’re considering a more expansive policy, it may be worth seeking professional advice.

This is an issue that governments, companies, and individuals are grappling with now that the COVID-19-induced shift to remote work has opened up this possibility for a growing number of workers across many industries. Specifically, the answer will depend on a number of factors, including immigration policies, the nature of the work, and the length of stay. What does “work from anywhere” mean?Work-from-anywhere (WFA) policies permit employees to work remotely abroad on a temporary basis, typically for more than seven days but fewer than 365. WFA policies differ from work-from-home policies, which generally apply to workers who stay within their country of residence and can choose to work from “home” either some or all of the time. Can remote work be permanent?While a small number of companies operated on a fully remote basis before the pandemic, more companies have made remote work a permanent part of their culture. Some businesses have mandated a full return to the office, others have chosen to remain fully remote, and others have opted for a hybrid model.

He serves as Toptal’s Chief Economist. Read MoreExpertiseVenture CapitalPrevious RoleFounding PartnerPREVIOUSLY ATShareShare The twin pillars upholding a successful venture fund are its ability to source the highest-quality deal flow and to add value to its portfolio companies, post-investment. While established funds like Sequoia Fund and Kleiner Perkins can achieve these ends through brand power alone, most funds need to offer something more. One value-add that doesn’t get enough recognition is talent sourcing. Tech founders often need help with more than raising capital. For emerging companies located in the major tech centers of Europe and the US, one of the greatest needs beyond capital is the ability to recruit and retain top talent. As a former VC, I know that this need is acute. Talent usually represents the greatest single outlay for a startup; it’s the engine that drives every other aspect of value creation. While talent exists in abundance in the wealthy cities and countries where many founders are based, the competition among large companies and other startups for these workers is fierce. That makes it increasingly expensive to hire locally and leads to high churn rates that can cost startups precious institutional knowledge they can’t afford to lose. That’s especially true in the tech space. Even before the Great Resignation, the technology sector had the highest turnover rate in the country, creating financial and opportunity costs equivalent to twice a departing employee’s salary. The solution, however, goes deeper than connecting your founders with an expensive recruiting firm that competes with everyone else for the same local talent. What VCs need to do is help portfolio companies leverage the power of remote work and cast a wider net for talent worldwide. Global talent sourcing was the central feature of Firstrock Capital, a high-tech venture fund I co-founded in 2014. I believe our approach represents the future of our field. It’s already garnering recognition. In 2019, Andrew Ng, the Coursera co-founder and AI entrepreneur, built a sizable AI team in Medellín, Colombia, which also served as my non-US base. Developing ties to the international workforce will not only benefit your organization but also the global economy by helping it become more inclusive, interconnected, and technology-driven. We need to rethink the role venture capital plays in high-tech startups, and reconfigure our priorities and processes to help portfolio companies build the strong, skilled, stable workforces that will enable them to succeed. Let me show you how. A New Venture Paradigm We know exceptional tech talent exists around the globe, but most US companies wait for talent to come to them. A hefty 64% of Silicon Valley’s technology professionals and 65% of its mathematics and computer science professionals aren’t US-born. A Georgetown University study found that 33 of the 50 American AI startups deemed most promising by Forbes have at least one immigrant founder. But visa programs can’t bring American tech firms all the talent they need. While there were 1.5 million unfilled US-based jobs in computer science in the US at the end of 2021, only ~56,000 H-1B work visa applications are allocated to this sector per year. Nonetheless, many investors prefer—or even demand—that their companies’ employees work locally. In some instances, that’s because they aren’t worried about acquiring the capital to help their companies afford higher salaries for a fully on-site team. Other times investors know their local startup community well and feel confident they can connect their companies with important resources, such as attorneys and prototyping labs. Yet most of these benefits concern knowledge transfer and fundraising rather than scaling, which is the most critical priority after fundraising. Likewise, the very strength of local ecosystems makes them brutally competitive places to staff a team. In order to maximize the positive impact you can have on your companies, you have to look outward. Our Global Talent Model The aim of my fund was to support our companies by overcoming the constraints of the local talent pool and taking advantage of all the ways remote work could help the companies thrive. Before we created our fund, my partners and I founded a number of talent development programs across the Americas. We launched our efforts in Medellín because of its strong existing tech ecosystem and the ease of doing business in Colombia. We also had some existing partnership opportunities there. Later, we expanded our footprint into most of Latin America and South America. Our efforts included creating a foundation where children could take coding classes and setting up various pre-accelerator and accelerator programs to help both individual talent and local startup teams prepare to go global. A weekend robotics and IoT hackathon in Medellín organized by Stettler’s fund and local engineering leaders. (Credit: Erik Stettler) These programs ensured that when we established our fund, we had a qualified talent pool for our portfolio companies to tap. While we didn’t set out to build a one-stop-shop pipeline from education to hire, that was the effective result. Many of the graduates from our coding and accelerator programs went on to work for our portfolio companies or to found their own companies that we helped to fund. Ours was a plain-vanilla US venture fund incorporated in Delaware that invested in other US companies. However, each of these companies had foreign wholly owned subsidiaries that facilitated the payment and contracting for their non-US team members but held no intellectual property of their own. When we launched in 2014, our approach was hybrid: Our model was a US-based executive team and a globally distributed junior staff. Advances in technology and remote management practices now make it practical to look abroad for senior leaders as well. While telecommuting is now easier than ever, it’s still important to maintain an on-the-ground presence for talent development and recruiting, as those face-to-face connections will help establish the nodes of your global network. One of the top misconceptions about hiring global talent is that the main value proposition is cost savings. While that may be true, it’s only part of the story. The fact is this strategy lets you not only maximize the impact of your budget, but also greatly improves both the speed to hire and subsequent retention rates. For early-stage companies, keeping the team small and senior is optimal. By sourcing globally, a company can afford more senior team members early on, and will likely retain them longer because there will be less cutthroat competition for staff located outside the major tech hubs. That stability preserves continuity when a startup needs it most. During my time with our fund, we invested in 50 software- and data-driven companies in the US and abroad. With our help, they were able to recruit top engineering and data science talent in a matter of weeks rather than months and enjoy an annual turnover in the low single digits rather than tech industry averages that can exceed 20%. Our companies were also able to grow and reach operational breakeven much faster with less need for external capital. This financial and operational agility helped our portfolio companies survive the black swan of a pandemic without being forced to shut down—even those doing business in sectors most directly affected, such as construction and events. How to Transform Venture Capital There are a number of principles we developed for creating a forward-looking VC fund. But before I discuss them, I want to make it clear that this strategy is not outsourcing. Outsourcing refers to contracting a firm (rather than individual people) to build a product with its own engineering staff. I don’t recommend that approach for early-stage companies, as it creates ambiguity around the ownership of critical elements of the product and conflicts with the learning process inherent in Agile development. Successfully executing the strategy I recommend means not only hiring global talent directly, but also committing to help build the global talent pool first. Recruiting is the final piece of the puzzle. Don’t Be Afraid to Start Small As you search for potential talent hubs, don’t limit yourself to big cities. In the US and abroad, smaller cities often become stronger tech and startup hubs than the primary commercial and government centers. The startup communities in the Denvers and Atlantas of the world are places where it’s easier to network and less expensive to do business. Invest in Talent Development Consider launching tech education programs, as we did. The benefits are twofold: You’re helping to train the next generation of tech workers, and your foundation may provide a tax-efficient means to reinvest your fund’s returns into the long-term talent pool your portfolio companies need. You might also consider partnering with tech universities and meetups, and co-sponsoring coding boot camps with local or international organizations. These are effective ways to build your talent network and to connect with key leaders in technology and business in those regions. These partnerships can help you identify potential CIO and CTO candidates for your portfolio companies too. That’s important because once your portfolio companies are ready to hire, you should help them establish their executive teams first to ensure that junior hires align with the companies’ strategies. For tech companies, the most effective and scalable approach is to first hire a senior technology leader with experience working in your target region—in our case, Latin America—and empower them to use their knowledge of that region to staff the team. And remember, all of these connections aren’t just people you hire for the job at hand—they may become future founders whose companies you invest in down the road. Leaders of Stettler’s portfolio companies speak to local tech workers in Medellín, Colombia, about startup career paths. (Credit: Erik Stettler) For funds embarking on this strategy, I recommend focusing initially on geographies with similar time zones to streamline the logistical and operational elements. As a US-based fund, for example, we focused on select cities in the Western Hemisphere. European VCs facing ultracompetitive labor markets should likewise look to build partnerships with emerging tech hubs in Africa. Once you’ve found your footing in a few localities, you can expand to a fully global approach. Recruit Respectfully Even though there may be less competition outside the major Western tech hubs, recruiting top talent isn’t easy anywhere. When approaching potential senior leaders to connect with your portfolio companies, don’t underestimate their other options. You may be competing with large global companies that are able to pay more than you can at first. What you offer is the opportunity to take ownership in something new and to gain exposure to emerging technologies and ideas. Before you recruit a potential senior leader, approach them first for advice on your portfolio company’s product and business model, and on how to engage with their areas’ tech communities first. Be sincere about your interest because if they ultimately take the job, they will expect to use their expertise to grow the company. Build Teams Without Borders Encourage your portfolio companies to treat their global talent as part of the same team. US team members should spend significant time with their international counterparts. If the company is fully US-based, then it should bring new non-US team leaders stateside for at least a month of onboarding. If the whole team is already fully remote, US leaders should include new international senior staff in any annual retreats or important in-person events. Remember Legal Jurisdictions Legally, your companies require both US and local jurisdictions. They will each need to create a local subsidiary to act as a pass-through vehicle to send funds from the US to pay local team members. The team members should have employment contracts with both the parent company and this local entity. This provides companies with recourse through their local jurisdictions, if needed. Any share or option grants are only offered through the US entity, however, as this is where the economic value resides. Partner Locally Above all, don’t go it alone. The right partnerships are critical to any global business venture, and there will be many universities, tech meetups, investors, and incubators that will welcome international co-investors and partners. And don’t forget the local VC community. Having a rich local community of value-add investors where you’re hiring also plays a critical role in getting founders to their initial launches and helping them to gain traction. As with everything in entrepreneurship and technology, begin on a small scale to validate your approach and learn from errors along the way. It’s Time for Venture Capital to Change Talent is both a startup’s greatest expense and its source of all value creation. Investors have a fiduciary duty to maximize the returns for capital invested, and the most sustainable solution is to rethink where and how talent is sourced. Thanks to the many cloud-based telecommuting solutions that the VC industry helped launch, it’s now easier than ever for companies to build and manage high-performing global teams. The greatest opportunity of our time to do well and do good is to resolve the problem that talent is everywhere but the chance to use it is not. Venture capital is uniquely poised to level the playing field. The future of talent is global, and by investing in talent first, you will strengthen the companies you invest in, help grow entrepreneurship in areas that have been overlooked, and participate in building a global economy that is open, innovative, and resilient enough to meet the challenges of the 21st century.
