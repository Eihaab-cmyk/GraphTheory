7 Secret Habits That Will Make You an Unstoppable Writer | by Saurav Mandal | New Writers Welcome | MediumOpen in appSign upSign inWriteSign upSign in7 Secret Habits That Will Make You an Unstoppable WriterHack your lifestyle to write 10x betterSaurav Mandal·FollowPublished inNew Writers Welcome·8 min read·Oct 12, 2023--168ListenSharePhoto by Kelly Sikkema on UnsplashStaring at a blank screen with a blinking cursor is the scariest moment for every writer. Sometimes, ideas just don’t flow. Other times, you have a great idea but struggle to put it into words.I have been there a lot during my 2.5 years as a writer. And I know this is what makes you hate the process. It’s what messes with your consistency and traps you in the dark cave of writer’s block.But remember, there are solutions to every problem. In this case, the solution is these 7 powerful habits that can transform you as a writer. They will boost your skills and make you truly enjoy the process.I have personally practiced these habits and seen their benefits. On top of that, many successful novelists, copywriters, and authors swear by them too.And no, this isn’t your generic advice, like writing daily in the morning. Actually, these habits have less to do with writing and more with your lifestyle. These are things you do away from your computer.So, ready to be a captivating writer? Here we go…1. Hand-CopyingI have been doing this for a couple of months now. And believe me when I say it’s the most powerful exercise to improve your writing.All you have to do is just take a great piece of writing and copy it in your handwriting as it is. Simple.You can copy anything that is well-written. If you want to be a copywriter, hand-copy proven and successful ads in the past. If you want to be a novelist, hand-copy chapters of novels by your favorite authors. And so on.How is this exercise so effective? Well, when you write something in your handwriting, that piece of writing becomes a part of you. The words, the sentence structure, the flow, the rhythm, the sequence of information, and everything that makes it great gets programmed into your mind.You understand what it is that makes beautiful writing so beautiful. You start to think and act like successful writers. However, don’t expect quick results. This may take months of regular practice, and the effort is completely worth it.This (hand-copying) isn’t just an empty experience. This is a way of internally imprinting on your mind and body, the process of good writing.— Gary Halbert, The Boron Letters2. WalkingThis is me walking, I do it daily at 5 AM.There was a time when I used to work all day long in my closed room. I wouldn’t go out. I wouldn’t see the open sky. I wouldn’t breathe fresh air. And this continued for around 37 days.Then, I started feeling sluggish and blunt. I struggled to come up with ideas. It was like my creativity was dying.Then, one day, I read a tweet that shared how walking for just 30 minutes improves your brain function and makes you creative. I researched more and realized what I was missing.The next day, I started walking first thing in the morning for around 45 minutes. Within a few days, I saw the difference. And truth be told, I didn’t expect a simple habit like walking can have such incredible effects.So, based on what I experienced and what the research says, here’s how walking can help you write better:· It reduces your stress and refreshes your mind· It lets you remain focused throughout the day· It sharpens thinking and improves reasoning· You get creative ideas while walking· Your work productivity shoots upThat’s a lot of benefits!So, walk in the morning or between your writing sessions. Do it in natural settings with open space and fresh air if possible. This simple activity can have a tremendous positive impact on your mental and physical health.If you are seeking creative ideas, go out walking. Angels whisper to a man when he goes for a walk.— Raymond Inmon3. ReadingYou already know about this one. But I am not simply asking you to read in your mind. You have to READ ALOUD. (I mean, not so loud that your neighbor has a hard time sleeping. Just loud enough so that you can hear it.)You can read aloud those great writing pieces you have selected for the hand-copy purpose (habit #1).The benefits of reading aloud are similar to the hand-copy habit. It feeds your mind with great writing and lets you understand the writing process of successful artists.It programs your mind so well that words come naturally when you sit down to write. And it’s powerful because you engage three of your senses- eyes, tongue, and ear in this activity.I READ ALOUD whenever I find well-written material, be it novels, self-help books, blogs, Medium stories, and marketing copy. This not only improves my writing but also inspires me to write more.Reading is like breathing in, and writing is like breathing out.— Pam Allyn4. JournalingJournaling is a terrific activity to sharpen your writing skills. All you have to do is take a diary and write down your day-to-day events.You can record your thoughts, share your mistakes, or describe your daily experiences (whether painful or exciting).This exercise is helpful because it forces you to write consistently. You learn to face the blank page and fill it with your ideas. You have your creative juices flowing every day, which helps you combat writer’s block.Journaling lets you practice organizing thoughts, expressing emotions, and describing things in your mind. This is a free writing exercise you do without pressure or deadline. So, you develop a deep love for the craft of writing.I have been journaling for the last 7 years. And I feel so proud to see the diaries I have filled with daily happenings. It’s like I am writing my life story.This is my current diary. (Maybe after I die, the diary gets published as a book: The Dairy of Medium Writer… just kidding!)I can shake off everything if I write; my sorrows disappear, my courage is reborn.― Anne Frank, The Diary of a Young Girl5. MeditationI don’t think I need to talk much about this. You already know how meditation can calm your mind and improve your focus. But I had to include this on the list because it is a MUST exercise for writers.If you are like most creative people, you would often be agitated, worried, scared, hopeless, or stressed. Meditation helps you deal with all these.Just 10 minutes of good meditation, and your mind gets into a state of monk-like peacefulness. The stress reduces, your ability to concentrate increases, and your productivity gets boosted. Your mind slows down for sharp thinking and creative ideas pay you a visit.You see what’s happening here? Just 10 minutes a day is letting you work with laser focus for the rest of the day. You have to admit meditation is the best ROI for your time.And that’s actually the reason I meditate daily. Honestly speaking, I don’t want to do it some days because sitting down and focusing on your breathing is plain boring. But I meditate anyway. Because most good things in life are those you won’t like doing.Silence is a source of Great Strength.― Lao Tzu6. Watching TVPhoto by Thibault Penin on UnsplashIt’s time to drop the misconception that watching TV wastes time. Because movies and TV series can actually make you a better writer. Here’s how:First of all, movies and TV series are basically stories. So, consuming them is the best way to learn the art of storytelling.You can observe how a TV series hooks you and makes you binge-watch it. See how they create story gaps that urge you to find out what happens next. Then, you can apply the same concept in your writing to make the readers curious and fully immersed in your work.Second, movies use a lot of sensory details like expressions, lighting, colors, sounds, music, costume designs, framing, etc., that make you feel things. You can mostly replicate these details in your writing with the help of descriptive language so that it can also evoke emotions.Third, observe the dialogues. Almost all great movies have concise, crisp, and easy-to-understand dialogues. This can teach you how to convey a point in the least possible words and be bold in your writing.If you ask me, Forrest Gump, Dark, The Office, Breaking Bad, and The Dark Knight are some movies and TV shows with the best dialogues.Movies can also be a tremendous source of inspiration and creativity. So, I would suggest you see at least one or two movies a week. You can also spend 20–30 minutes watching an episode of a series daily. Just do it through the eyes of a writer, and you will learn a lot.A good movie makes the audience feel like they’ve journeyed with the characters.― Rich Moore7. Doing NothingYeah, you read that right. Do nothing. Just sit down and stare at the wall.You see, what happens with most writers is they race from one task to another. You may juggle between writing, reading, working in the day job, scrolling social media, planning, shopping, spending time with family, and so on. These are important tasks. But they really exhaust your mind.Doing nothing gives you a much-needed break. This is the time when you shut the external noise and listen to yourself. You disengage your mind from everything, and so it gets a chance to:· Make connections between things· Find genius solutions to your problems· See everything from a different angle· Come up with some brilliant ideasThe brain is in the peak creative state when it has to do nothing. I have got some of the best LinkedIn post, blog post, and YouTube video ideas while sitting idly.So, spend about 20 minutes daily just gazing out the window or staring at the ceiling. You can also do house chores or engage in other art forms like painting. The idea is to free your mind.This is me, doing nothing.Sometimes sitting and doing nothing is the best something you can do.― Karen SalmansohnSumming UpI have found these 7 habits extremely powerful. And so are thousands of other writers. But this doesn’t mean it will be the same for you. Everybody is different, and there is no one-size-fits-all approach. So experiment and see which works for you and makes you the most creative and productive.Thanks for reading.

The secret life of people with high self-control (it’s easier than you think) | by Riikka Iivanainen | MediumOpen in appSign upSign inWriteSign upSign inThe secret life of people with high self-control (it’s easier than you think)Research suggests that people with high self-control are good at avoiding temptation — not resisting itRiikka Iivanainen·Follow8 min read·Jan 9, 2024--505ListenShare“If only I had more self-control.”“I don’t have such an iron mind.”“I want to enjoy life, too — not just suffer.”These are comments I might get when people learn about my lifestyle.I’m one of those annoying people who eats lots of fruits and vegetables, exercises five times a week, saves a portion of their salary, and writes or reads every morning before work — I have good self-control. What’s more, retaining this lifestyle doesn’t feel particularly difficult to me; I don’t grit my teeth to avoid unhealthy foods, the warmth of the couch, or Black Friday deals.That’s why I’ve often wondered why some people succeed at resisting temptations while others struggle.To find some answers, I decided to peek into the science of willpower. A peek turned into a deep dive, and I ended up reading over 25 academic papers over the course of two months.Now I want to share with you what I learned. Consider it a story about how researchers learned what good self-controllers knew all along.Photo by Thao LEE on UnsplashThe lucky ones with good self-controlI have some good news and some bad news for the ones who believe they need stronger willpower to reach their professional, academic, dietary, athletic, or any other goals.Let’s start with the “bad” news:High self-control does predict many positive life outcomes: People who’re good at self-control do better in school, have fewer mental health problems, have better relationships with friends and family, and generally exhibit fewer impulsive behaviors like binge eating and alcohol abuse.¹They’re even happier:“Contrary to the Puritan hypothesis and other views of self-control as grim sacrifice and stern self-discipline, people with high [trait self-control] typically felt better than others even in the present moment, as well as being more satisfied with their lives in general.”²(I’m sorry if you were secretly wishing they’d at least be miserable.)One group of researchers went as far as calling self-control “one of the most powerful and beneficial adaptations of the human psyche.”¹ Hyperbole, much?Here’s the good news:Having good self-control doesn’t mean a constant battle against temptations. The kind of self-control that gets you all those good outcomes is more effortless than what’s commonly suggested by the terms “willpower” and “self-discipline.”The rest of this article will be devoted to explaining why that is. The point is not to claim that resisting temptations in the moment doesn’t work (in fact, it works about 80% of the time³) but to show that that’s not what good self-controllers are generally relying on.When we resist temptations, we get depleted — some more than othersLooking at the type of research conducted under the notion of self-control, it seems like researchers took the term literally and found a convenient way to study it in a lab: “Self-control must be about ‘self’ and ‘control’ so let’s see what happens when people resist temptation.”A popular way to study such in-the-moment acts of self-control has been the dual-task paradigm. As the name suggests, it has two parts:First, participants do a task that requires resisting temptation or inhibiting impulses. For example, they’re asked to eat radishes while staring at a bowl of cookies or to avoid showing or feeling any emotions while watching a movie.⁴Then, the participants do a second, unrelated task — often some kind of puzzle like a series of anagrams.What most of these experiments find is that the people who need to exert self-control in the first part perform less well in the second one.⁵ Based on these findings, researchers have argued that:Resisting temptations is tiring. The resulting mental fatigue has been coined ego depletion.Self-control draws upon a limited resource similarly to a muscle, hence the term muscle/strength model of self-control.⁴But here’s the twist:The positive life outcomes discussed earlier aren’t based on ego depletion studies; they‘re primarily based on studies which have measured self-control through a self-report questionnaire.¹ So up until recently, we didn’t know what exactly was driving them.Do some people just have stronger willpower muscles, meaning they get less depleted after resisting temptations? Based on the number of studies on ego depletion this is a tempting hypothesis.Luckily, we don’t have to guess because a group of German researchers put it to the test.⁶ They set up experiments following the dual-task paradigm, but they also measured participants’ level of self-control via a questionnaire (the same one used in the meta-analysis associating self-control with many desirable life outcomes).What they found was that good self-controllers were more vulnerable to ego depletion: They ate more candy and made riskier decisions in a game of dice after exerting self-control.⁶ More candy? Riskier decisions?“Trait self-control did not buffer against ego depletion; the people describing themselves as good self-controllers seemed to have weaker, not stronger, self-control muscles.”The researchers called these results ironic for a reason. Trait self-control did not buffer against ego depletion; the people describing themselves as good self-controllers seemed to have weaker — not stronger — self-control muscles.What’s going on? If trait self-control doesn’t protect against ego depletion, what’s behind all those desirable life outcomes?People with high self-control experience fewer temptations in their daily livesWhile I was researching this article, all roads seemed to lead to one particular paper that wasn’t even directly about self-control. Based on the number of times it was referenced, its findings seemed to really have taken the self-control community by surprise.The paper was about everyday temptations, or in academese, the “phenomenology of desire in everyday life,” and it applied the experience sampling method.³Basically, the researchers asked about 200 people in Würzburg, Germany, to wear beepers for a week and to report on their current or recent desires whenever the beeper went off (seven times each day). If they were experiencing a desire, they were asked a few clarifying questions about it and, on some samples, also about the situation they were in (e.g., whether they’d consumed alcohol or whether they were alone or in company).Most of the study’s findings were unsurprising:Participants were experiencing some type of desire about 50% of the time.Most commonly, they wished to eat, sleep, drink, use media, or have leisure time or social contact.When participants applied self-control, they often managed to resist the temptation they were facing, about 80% of the time.But the findings related to a specific subset of participants — the ones scoring high on a trait measure of self-control— were more surprising. These participants didn’t have fewer desires overall, but they did have fewer problematic desires: They reported less conflict and less resistance related to their desires.In other words, the people who scored high on trait self-control experienced fewer temptations in their daily lives.These findings are like having researchers finally move their focus away from individual acts of self-control to the people who’re actually good at it only to find these people smirking, “You thought we were going through life gritting our teeth, huh? Oh, you fools!”“People with high levels of trait self-control are good at avoiding temptation — not resisting it.”What did the authors of the everyday temptation paper make of their findings? Well, they suggested that people with high levels of trait self-control are good at avoiding temptation — not resisting it.“This conclusion suggests a reconsideration of how this trait operates.”³ Oh snap!Their conclusion also aligns with the ironic findings related to ego depletion: If good self-controllers generally avoid temptation, it’s understandable that they’d perform poorly when put into an artificial situation in which they’re forced to resist temptation.⁶ If you don’t lift heavy things, you’re not gonna get strong.Another study tested this temptation-avoidance hypothesis and found that the people who scored high on trait self-control also reported more frequently using strategies to minimize or avoid temptation.⁷ And it wasn’t all talk: They were more likely to choose to work without distractions, for example, to pick a quiet room over a noisy one before beginning a problem-solving task.But making individual smart choices doesn’t seem to be the only reason good self-controllers experience fewer temptations.People with high self-control are good at building and breaking habitsThe findings related to temptation avoidance have made researchers curious about the role habits may play in self-control. After all, habits are a way to reduce resistance by automatizing a behavior. Maybe that’s what those lucky people are good at.This does seem to be the case. One meta-analysis found that trait self-control was more strongly associated with automatic rather than consciously controlled behaviors.⁸More specifically, people high in trait self-control have been found to have…weaker unhealthy snacking habits,⁹stronger exercise habits,¹⁰ andstronger meditation habits three months after a meditation retreat.¹¹It seems that “by relying on stable habits and routines, individuals with better self-control can enact important behaviors more automatically and effortlessly.”¹¹Trait self-control doesn’t, however, predict behavior equally across life domains. It has the strongest effects on work and school behavior.⁸This makes sense if trait self-control is about building and breaking habits: It may be easier to create routines around working and studying as opposed to, for example, eating behavior which is much more affected by natural drives and genetic predispositions.⁸ It’s as if good self-controllers were saying, “If we can routinize it, we can ace it.”“The findings we’ve covered so far make it increasingly difficult to view self-control as an ‘all-purpose inhibiting mechanism.’ No wonder researchers have begun to differentiate between effortful and effortless self-control.”The findings we’ve covered so far make it increasingly difficult to view self-control as an “all-purpose inhibiting mechanism.”⁸ No wonder researchers have begun to differentiate between effortful and effortless self-control.And although effortful self-control is common in everyday life, the effortless kind seems to be the one driving those enviable long-term outcomes.Meta-self-control — preventing the need for effortful self-controlI recently told a friend about how I regulate my TV-watching behavior: I try to refrain from starting a new series because I know that if I do, I’ll end up binge-watching the entire season. “That requires self-discipline,” my friend commented.My friend was right: It requires self-discipline not to start a new series. But not starting a new series requires less self-discipline than not watching another episode of Ted Lasso after just finishing one.The fact that good self-controllers experience fewer temptations doesn’t mean that they never use self-control. They just use self-control more strategically or at an earlier stage:“To be sure, avoiding temptation is itself an act of self-regulation, indeed one requiring forethought, effective anticipation, and self-knowledge. — — In a sense, avoiding temptation is a meta-regulation strategy that enables the self-regulator to manage self-regulatory resources effectively. By avoiding temptations, one can save oneself the presumably greater expenditure of willpower that would be necessary to resist them, thereby putting oneself less often into a depleted and vulnerable state.”⁷The people who seem good at self-control are probably just good at anticipating potential self-control failure and doing things to prevent it. They’re acing meta-self-control.ReferencesI’ve compiled all the papers I referenced into a Google Doc. Check it out if you want to dig deeper.I wrote a part 2 for this story.
