The naming convention for generations is not a precise science but rather a cultural shorthand that evolves organically. Here’s a condensed explanation for the name “Gen Z”:Alphabetical Sequence: After Gen X and Millennials (sometimes referred to as Gen Y), “Gen Z” naturally follows in the alphabetical progression.New Century’s Demographics: Gen Z represents the demographic group born in the 21st century, with unique traits and life experiences.Consensus on Naming: While various names were suggested, “Gen Z” became popular for its simplicity and has been widely accepted.Generational Identity: Members of Gen Z have embraced the term, using it to assert their distinct identity and generational consciousness.“Gen Z” thus stands as a label denoting the generational shift and its particular characteristics, marking a clear distinction from previous generations.What Are Gen Z Core ValuesGen Z, born generally between the mid-1990s and the early 2010s, has emerged as a generation with distinct core values shaping their worldviews and behaviors. Here’s a list of some of the most prominent:Social Awareness and Justice:Diversity and Inclusion: Gen Z strongly values inclusivity and representation across various identities, advocating for equality and challenging discrimination.Environmentalism: Sustainability and environmental protection are high priorities, leading to conscious consumerism and support for eco-friendly practices.Social Justice: Gen Z actively engages in social movements and campaigns related to human rights, racial equality, and global issues.Individualism and Authenticity:Entrepreneurial Spirit: Driven by independence and self-sufficiency, Gen Z thrives on creative innovation and building their own path, valuing entrepreneurship and side hustles.Mental Health Awareness: Openly discussing mental health issues and prioritizing emotional well-being are crucial for Gen Z, leading to self-care practices and advocacy for mental health resources.Personal Branding: Building a unique online presence and expressing individuality through social media platforms is part of their self-discovery and career development.Technological Savvy and Pragmatism:Digital Natives: Comfortable with technology and utilizing it for communication, information gathering, and creative expression.Critical Thinkers: Gen Z possesses a high level of digital literacy, leading to skepticism towards fake news and a tendency to fact-check and analyze information critically.Financial Responsibility: Having witnessed economic uncertainties, Gen Z prioritizes financial security and planning for the future, focusing on responsible spending and investments.Additionally:Community-Oriented: While emphasizing individual pursuits, Gen Z values genuine connections and building strong online and offline communities supporting shared interests and goals.Authentic Brands: They gravitate towards brands with transparent values and ethical practices that align with their own beliefs.Global Perspective: Growing up in an interconnected world, Gen Z embraces cultural diversity and has a keen awareness of global issues, advocating for international collaboration and solutions.It’s important to remember that these are general trends, and individual Gen Zers may have differing priorities and values. However, this list provides a valuable starting point for understanding the core principles driving this generation’s actions and choices.Gen Z Statistics That Matter to Marketers in 2024Gen Z, the first digital natives, are hitting their stride. Now aged 12–27, they represent a growing consumer force with distinct habits and priorities. To capture their attention, brands need to adapt.Here are some key Gen Z statistics for marketers to keep in mind in 2024:Generation Z Buying Power:$143 billion in spending power: Gen Z already wields significant economic clout, and this is expected to reach $2.43 trillion by 2026.Value-driven consumers: They prioritize ethical practices, sustainability, and social responsibility when making purchases.Brand authenticity: Transparency and alignment with their values are crucial for brand loyalty.Generation Z Social Media Savvy:84% active on social media: TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube are top platforms, with a preference for authentic, user-generated content.Micro-influencers hold sway: They trust relatable peers over traditional celebrities for recommendations.Social commerce on the rise: Gen Z loves seamless buying experiences directly through social media.Tech Addiction:Nearly 95% own smartphones: Mobile is their primary channel for information, communication, and entertainment.Short attention spans: Videos under 60 seconds and engaging visuals are key to grabbing their attention.Omnichannel experience: They expect a seamless transition between online and offline brand interactions.By understanding these key statistics and adapting your marketing approach accordingly, you can effectively connect with and engage Gen Z in 2024 and beyond. Remember, it’s all about being real, relatable, and aligned with their values, not just pushing products.Digital Natives: Understanding Gen Z’s Online BehaviorGeneration Z has grown up in a world where the internet, social media, and digital devices are a norm, not a novelty. This has fundamentally shaped their behavior and expectations. Unlike previous generations, for Gen Z, the digital world is not just a tool; it’s an integral part of their identity and lifestyle.Constant Connectivity: Gen Zers are connected to the internet almost constantly. This constant digital presence means they are accustomed to fast-paced, efficient communication and information consumption.Multi-Platform Usage: They don’t just stick to one platform or device. Their digital consumption spans across various devices and platforms, often simultaneously, seeking diverse forms of content and interaction.Visual and Interactive Content Preference: This generation prefers visual and interactive content like videos, infographics, and interactive apps. They’re less likely to engage with long-form written content, favoring quick, visually engaging material.Authenticity and Personalization: They value authenticity and personalization in their online experiences. Content that feels personal, relatable, and genuine resonates more deeply with them.Influence of Social Media: Social media isn’t just for connecting with friends; it’s a source of news, a way to engage with brands, and a platform for activism and self-expression.Understanding these traits is crucial for marketers aiming to capture the attention of Generation Z. Adapting strategies to meet their digital fluency can be the key to successful engagement with this influential demographic.Value-Driven Consumers: The Importance of Ethics and AuthenticityGeneration Z is not just tech-savvy; they are also deeply value-driven consumers. This section of the article will explore how their strong ethical values and search for authenticity significantly influence their consumer behavior and purchasing decisions.Ethical Consumption: Gen Z is more likely to support brands that align with their values, such as environmental sustainability, social justice, and inclusivity. They are conscious consumers who often research a brand’s ethical practices before making a purchase.Demand for Authenticity: This generation values genuine brand interactions. They prefer transparent and honest marketing over traditional advertising. Authentic storytelling that reflects real-life scenarios and diverse perspectives resonates well with them.Brand Loyalty and Advocacy: Once Gen Z consumers find a brand that aligns with their values, they can become loyal customers and even brand advocates, especially if the brand actively engages with them and contributes to causes they care about.Influence of Peer Reviews: They heavily rely on reviews and opinions from peers and influencers. Authentic, user-generated content and testimonials are more influential to Gen Z than celebrity endorsements or high-budget marketing campaigns.Marketing Strategies for Engaging Gen ZIn this part of the article, we will explore effective marketing strategies to engage Generation Z. This generation’s unique characteristics call for a tailored approach in marketing efforts.Embrace Digital Innovation: Utilize the latest digital tools and platforms to create interactive and immersive experiences. Augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and gamification can be particularly appealing.Content is King, But Context is Queen: While quality content is essential, the context in which it is delivered is equally important.

Causal Machine Learning in Marketing | by Heinrich Kögel | MediumOpen in appSign upSign inWriteSign upSign inCausal Machine Learning in MarketingHeinrich Kögel·Follow10 min read·Jul 31, 2023--13ListenShareThis article provides a case study that demonstrates how we can leverage causal machine learning for better decision-making in marketing.Understanding cause and effect is crucial in the business world. When it comes to pricing, for example, it is important to know how customers change their buying behavior when prices are adjusted. And to figure out if a marketing campaign is worth continuing, we need to understand if it actually has an impact on the KPIs we care about.It may seem obvious that understanding cause and effect is crucial when addressing these kinds of questions. But in reality, people often confuse causation with mere correlation, which can lead to costly mistakes in decision-making. Let’s look at an example that illustrates this point.The costly mistake of confusing correlation and causationImagine an ice cream parlor that decides to advertise in the local newspaper during the summer. After placing the ads, the owner notices an increase in sales and concludes that the ad campaign was a huge success. After all, sales were much higher during the campaign compared to the rest of the year. Thus, the owner plans to spend more money on newspaper ads. However, what the owner does not realize is that ice cream sales are always higher in the summer, regardless of any ads. Besides, hardly anyone reads the local newspaper anymore, so the ads did not really make a difference. In statistical terms, the owner confused correlation and causation. The ad campaign was correlated with higher sales because it took place in summer. But it did not actually cause the increase. This confusion leads the owner to make the expensive decision to keep running the ad campaign. Although this is only a stylized example, it highlights just how crucial it is to understand causal relationships and not confuse them with plain correlation when making business decisions.Source: https://xkcd.com/552/A/B Testing is not always feasibleIn data science and business, a commonly used approach to estimate causal effects is conducting A/B tests. The tradition of A/B tests dates back many centuries, with its origins in medicine. Other terms for A/B tests include experiments, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and split tests. The fundamental concept behind an A/B test revolves around the random assignment of units of observation, such as customers, into two distinct groups. One group, referred to as the treatment group, receives a specific intervention or treatment, such as a marketing email. The other group, known as the control group, does not receive any treatment. By comparing the treatment group with the control group, we can determine the causal effect of the intervention on the KPIs of interest due to the random assignment.However, while A/B testing can be a valuable tool in many settings, it is not always feasible in real-world scenarios. For example, it is probably not advisable for a company to randomly allocate its marketing budget across markets to test the effectiveness of its marketing strategy. In addition to situations where A/B testing may be too costly or risky, there are also scenarios in which A/B testing can be too time-consuming to obtain actionable insights or even prohibited by law due to ethical considerations.Causal machine learning to learn from naturally-collected dataIn such circumstances, causal machine learning comes to the rescue as a valuable solution. This relatively new field combines rigorous statistical and econometric theory, developed over decades, with flexible, novel machine learning methods. Causal machine learning techniques enable the estimation of causal effects without relying on A/B tests. Instead, they leverage “naturally collected” data, such as information about customers and prices, to estimate causal effects.One powerful approach in the toolkit of causal machine learning methods is the double machine learning approach by Chernozhukov et al. (2018). Since its development, the approach has been extended in numerous research papers. It allows to estimate causal effects in a reliable way and has desirable statistical properties. The user guide section of the doubleML package provides a great introduction to the method.In the following, we present a case study that leverages the double machine learning approach to make informed decisions in marketing. The case study is inspired by real-world consulting projects that we conducted jointly with multiple medium-sized and large companies. For confidentiality reasons, the data used in the case study are simulated.Case study: Estimating the effect of a marketing campaignIn this case study, we examine TechGear, a company that sells computer equipment to other businesses. In the past year, TechGear ran a marketing campaign offering discounts to certain customer firms. Now, the marketing managers are thinking about whether they should continue providing these discounts. To make an informed decision, they want to assess the effectiveness of offering discounts and determine if it actually boosted sales. Ideally, they would like to conduct an A/B test to measure the impact. Unfortunately, conducting such a test is not feasible due to time and budget constraints.Thus, to evaluate the campaign’s effectiveness, the team initially considers comparing average sales from the customer firms that received the discount and those that did not. However, during discussions on how to evaluate the campaign, one of the managers mentions that larger firms, as measured by the number of employees, were more likely to receive the discount. Additionally, TechGear has higher sales with larger firms. This raises concerns among the data scientists. They explain that simply comparing sales between the firms that received the discount and those that did not could lead to incorrect conclusions.Confounding variables lead to false conclusions in naive estimationsTo understand why this comparison would be misleading, let’s look at the following figure that illustrates the relationship between receiving the discount, firm size, and sales. We are interested in understanding the effect of receiving the discount on sales (arrow 1). However, we also know that firm size influences the likelihood of receiving the discount (arrow 2), and that larger firms tend to result in higher sales (arrow 3). In causal terminology, we refer to firm size as a “confounding variable” because it is associated with both discount and sales. If we do not account for the influence of this confounding variable when estimating the effect of the discount, we will obtain an incorrect estimate.We want to estimate the effect of discount on sales. Firm size is a confounding variable.To illustrate this, consider an extreme example. Let’s say TechGear’s average sales to large firms were $100, while sales to small firms were $50. Furthermore, let’s assume that the discount had no effect on sales, and all large firms received the discount while small firms did not. If we were trying to determine the effect of the discount on sales by comparing the average sales between the firms that received the discount and those that did not, we would obtain an incorrect result. This is because we would effectively be comparing large and small firms. Despite the assumption that the discount has no effect, we would mistakenly conclude that the discount increased sales by $100-$50 = $50 per firm. To isolate the causal effect, we need to “control for” or “hold constant” the confounding variables in our estimation.Back at the brainstorming session of our team at TechGear, things become even more complicated when another marketing manager points out that the discount was also more frequently given in the first quarter of the year when customer firms typically made more purchases from TechGear. And this manager is also uncertain about whether there may be other confounding variables, which could have simultaneously influenced receiving the discount and sales.Causal machine learning to estimate the campaign’s effectivenessFortunately, TechGear has a comprehensive customer database that contains various customer characteristics, including sales, firm size, and whether a firm received the discount. This enables the data scientists to employ the double machine learning approach to estimate the effect of the discount on sales.Specifically, they decide to estimate a partially linear regression model, which consists of two main equations. The model can be expressed as follows:Equation (1) represents the relationship of interest, connecting sales with the receipt of the discount. Coefficient θ represents the effect of receiving the discount on sales. Vector X includes any variables suspected to be confounding variables, meaning variables that influence both sales and the receipt of the discount. Function g is a flexible function that models the relationship between the variables in X and sales. The second equation serves as a “helper equation” that is necessary for the double machine learning approach to be able to leverage modern machine learning techniques in estimating the causal effect of the discount on sales. This equation captures the relationship between the receipt of the discount and our set of potential confounders X. The variables ɛ and η are random noise terms. For more detailed information on the theory behind the double machine learning approach, please see Chernozhukov et al. (2018) and the user guide of the doubleML package.After examining the customer database, the data scientists discover approximately 3000 customers in the database. They decide to include five variables as potential confounding variables in the model: firm size (measured by the number of employees), the quarter of the year when a company made a purchase from TechGear, sales prior to the year of the discount campaign, if a firm’s headquarters is located in the US, and the number of markets in which a firm operates.Once they determined which variables to incorporate into the model, they utilize the doubleML package to estimate the effect of the discount. The estimation process follows a few simple steps. Firstly, they create the data object for the double machine learning estimation. There they specify the main variables for the analysis and the data, which they have already loaded in a pandas dataframe:import pandas as pdimport doubleml as dmlfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier, RandomForestRegressornp.random.seed(123)# Specify the potential confounderspotential_confounders = [ 'size', 'past_sales', 'quarter', 'number_markets_active', 'headquarters_us']# Instantiate the doubleML data objectdata_dml = dml.DoubleMLData( data=df, y_col='sales', d_cols='discount', x_cols=potential_confounders)Next, they specify the two learners to estimate the relationship between sales and the potential confounding variables X, as well as the relationship between the discount and X. To model the relationship between sales and X in equation (1), they utilize a random forest regressor. Similarly, they use a random forest classifier to capture the relationship between the discount and X in equation (2). By using random forest learners, the data scientists can estimate these relationships in a highly flexible way, without imposing strong assumptions on the functional forms of g and m. This flexibility allows them to capture complex patterns and interactions in the data, making the estimation process more reliable.# Instantiate random forest learnersrf_reg = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=500)rf_class = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=500)# Instantiate the doubleML partially linear regression modeldml_plr = dml.DoubleMLPLR( obj_dml_data=data_dml, ml_l=rf_regressor, ml_m=rf_classifier)Finally, they apply the fit method and print the results for the estimation.# Run estimationdml_plr.fit()# Print estimation resultsdml_plr.summaryThe data scientists discover that providing the discount increases sales by approximately $3200 per firm, as indicated by the value in the column “coef”. This estimate is highly significant, with a p-value below 1%. It is also quite close to the true effect of $3000 that was specified when simulating the data for this case study (although the data scientists are unaware of this, of course). Equipped with this result, the data scientists schedule the next meeting with the marketing managers to present their findings.The campaign has little effect — find alternative marketing measures!After thoughtful consideration, the marketing managers express satisfaction that the discount had a positive impact on sales. However, given that TechGear’s average sales to firms amount to around $96,000, they decide that they need to explore other marketing measures that can have a more substantial effect on sales. As the meeting progresses, one of the marketing managers remains curious and wants to know what the estimated effect would have been if the data scientists had applied a simple, naïve mean comparison between the sales from firms that received the discount and those that did not, without controlling for any confounding variables. The data scientists respond that, in that case, the estimated effect would have been around $18,300. The marketing managers feel relieved that the data scientists employed causal machine learning to estimate the effect of the discount. Without this knowledge, they would have continued offering the discount without realizing its minimal impact on sales.Causality matters for sound decision-makingThank you for taking the time to read the article! This article emphasizes the importance of understanding the difference between correlation and causation. To make the right decisions when it comes to cause-and-effect relationships, we need to use the appropriate methods. Causal machine learning provides a helpful framework for teasing out causality from data and gaining deeper insights.The case study presented serves as an illustration of the power of causal machine learning in marketing. However, it is important to note that the potential of causal machine learning extends beyond this specific scenario. In practice, causal machine learning, including double machine learning, can be applied in various areas and contexts. In addition to learning from naturally collected data, causal machine learning can also be utilized in A/B testing. For example, it can assist in developing personalized decision rules for targeted marketing strategies.If you have any questions or thoughts you would like to share, please feel free to comment below or reach out to me.AcknowledgmentsI thank Martin Spindler and Sven Klaassen for providing valuable input for this article.About the authorHeinrich is a Data Science Manager at Economic AI.

The Power Of Distinctive Brand Assets | by Pedro Porto Alegre | MediumOpen in appSign upSign inWriteSign upSign inThe Power Of Distinctive Brand AssetsPedro Porto Alegre·Follow6 min read·Dec 6, 2023--6ListenShareMany of us grew up seeing brand mascots on TV. While nowadays we often associate this type of distinctive asset with sports teams, this is only ONE of the many levers a brand can pull to drive clarity.In brand marketing there’s a metric called “brand clarity”, which when firing at all cylinders holds the keys to fandom.But before we dive into what brand clarity means exactly, we need to work backwards. Why building a fandom is important, anyway?Let’s run a quick experiment — each of the following distinctive assets are tightly associated with a respective brand (I’ll share the answers at the end of this article). How many of these do you know?Triangle = salty snack brandGecko = auto insurance brandCheck = sports apparel brandMermaid = coffee brandStripes = sports apparel brandTiger = breakfast foodGolden Harp = beer brandHorse = beer brandGetting to own a distinctive asset is incredibly difficult and takes decades of consistent and persistent brand building efforts. These involve running ads that not only have large reach, but also high frequency. It involves incorporating such assets in every piece of communication that goes out. And far more important than that, it requires associating said assets with a fundamental truth — a human, category, or brand truth — , one that consumers can not only relate to, but also get behind.When you build an audience that perceives your brand as a badge for something that everyone in their community “just gets it”… well folks, you have yourself a fandom.Marketers Don’t Build Brands, Fans DoThe power of a highly engaged audience, also known as a fandom, is that it becomes an endless well of creative ideas. If you stay true to your community’s beliefs, it becomes a gift that keeps on giving.If you’re a sports fan you can certainly relate to being part of a fandom. There’s very few places you can walk into where people from all backgrounds, socioeconomic statuses, and creeds come together as one. That’s the power of live sports. Grown men will hug and cry over a championship or weep on each other’s shoulders over a devastating loss. It’s quite the sight to see.But not every company has the sway of a city behind them. Instead they have the opportunity to build communities that are not bound by geographical limitations, and still leverage similar strategies that sports team use to co-create values and beliefs that their fans share in common.The key piece here is “co-create”. In today’s world, consumers are not looking for companies to tell them what to believe in or how to behave — they’re looking for businesses that share similar values as them which allow them to help shape the brands that represent said beliefs. This exchange of ideas becomes almost like a dance, where these conceptual entities that we have come to call brands are fluid in how they show up without compromising the fundamental values shared by the community.When a brand reaches such a level of trust, their distinctive assets oftentimes become a symbol to the public that signals “I am part of this sub-culture”.An Ad With No Logo?Distinctive assets come in a variety of ways such as patterns, an iconic voice, a packaging shape, but they typically involve a logo and, when appropriate, a mascot.Having iconic distinctive assets can be a major driver of brand clarity. This pesky metric is extremely difficult to improve because it involves having nailed your positioning and then effectively bringing it to life through creative assets.Brand clarity is also tough to measure. It requires brand studies around aided and unaided recall, where researchers will ask questions such as “when you think of ridges, which salty snacks brand comes to mind?” (hint, Ruffles!).This means that, if you’re a brand that wants to begin entrenching a distinctive asset into your consumers’ minds, every piece of communications needs to tactfully incorporate these assets into them — from visual representations of a ridge, all the way to the sound of the crunch when people eat it, everything needs to remain consistent and protected.For example, if you’re Doritos and one of your distinctive assets is the triangle, you need to build communications that incorporate this shape in clever and breakthrough ways — such as when the brand ran a spot where Jack Harlow quit rapping to become a triangle player. Eventually, Doritos was running spots where they never even mentioned its name or showed the logo: the triangle said it all.Kill The Mascot!Brand mascots have come to be one of the most effective ways to drive brand clarity known to man. So much so that years ago, when Budweiser wanted to move on from their notorious “Bud”-”Weis”-”Er” frogs in order to give its iconic Clydesdales enough room to breathe again, they used their Super Bowl slot to shoot an ad where they killed the frogs.You can’t make this stuff up.Iconic mascots such as Tony The Tiger, Pillsbury Doughboy, Mr. Peanut, Chester Cheetah, Energizer Bunny, and the Michelin Man have played such a part in shaping culture that nowadays people will collect items with their various iterations over the years.Mascots have a few things going in their favour:(1) They humanize brands by giving it an ambassador voice;(2) They embody the brand’s personality in a relatable way, and;(3) They generate excitement and goodwill.Oftentimes, these characters also bring a baggage of preconceptions with them that drive home the brand’s identity even further (such as bunnies’ stamina or a cat’s mischievousness).“The Power of You — Distinctive Brand Assets”. Ipsos. May 2020.Now, should every brand have a mascot? Despite brands that have used their mascots effectively score higher in brand clarity than their peers, not every category benefits from them.For example, if you sell fitness supplements you likely want to show a fit person; if you sell shampoo, a real person with real hair is more relatable; if you make face cream, same story. You see the trend — if it relates to someone’s physical appearance, real humans often perform better.How about B2B businesses? While it’s not common to see B2B mascots in the wild, that’s not to say that they aren’t welcome in that arena. It goes back to how your customers are making decisions — if they’re looking to make serious and consequential decisions about the future of their business, a mascot won’t do much good. But if your B2B company is in the business of making things easier and more joyful to interact with (such as Salesforce or MailChimp), a mascot will go a long way in making it more approachable and relatable (cue Astro and Freddie The Chimp).Being Noticed and Becoming MemorableWhether you lean into a shape, a sound, or a mascot, it’s imperative that what you choose is ownable to your brand and has enough legs to stand on for a long time.It’s a big decision to introduce a distinctive asset out of the blue — most brands grow into them — so if you don’t have one yet, think about what’s unique about your value proposition. How can you begin flexing those muscles more often and more consistently across your communications?Take, for example, Coke’s succinct 1915 brief to the packaging agency that designed their iconic bottles:“A bottle so distinct that it could be recognized by touch in the dark or when lying broken on the ground.”Whether you’re manufacturing a distinctive asset from zero, or believe you might have something your brand is already known for, driving brand clarity with your fans will yield some of the best ROI your company could ever dream of.Answers: Doritos, Geico, Nike, Starbucks, Adidas, Frosted Flakes, Guinness, Budweiser.PPATimeless insights at the crossroads of marketing and philosophy — every Wednesday, in your inbox.Originally published at https://marketing-chronicles-newsletter.beehiiv.com.MarketingAdvertisingBrandingStrategySports----6FollowWritten by Pedro Porto Alegre77 FollowersStrategy Director @ WJ Agency.
