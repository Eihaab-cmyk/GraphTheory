Rules help to keep things in order; they keep people from harming others.Just as rules in society help to keep things in order, so do rules in our personal lives. These rules limit our wandering and responding to random stimuli and information with little or no impact on our long-term goals.There are six rules that you should adopt in life.Let’s dive in!1.) Invest heavily in yourselfThis is the key — our ticket to personal growth. Some call it ‘selfishness,’ but I see it as a personal investment.After all, we are our own best asset.Investing in ourselves isn’t just about financial returns; it’s a commitment of time and effort to become a better version of ourselves.Here’s the beauty of it: self-investment can significantly improve our lives without breaking the bank.Boosting confidence, positively impacting self-esteem, and acquiring new knowledge and skills — these are the returns on investing in oneself.Ways to invest in you:Explore Interests:Take a course, watch documentaries, or listen to a podcast.Dive into books that stretch your mind.Google your interests and let the discovery begin.Acquire Skills:Develop social, communication, and interpersonal skills.Consider formal training or workshops.Prioritize Health:Invest in healthier food choices.Join a gym or work with a personal trainer.Start a Side Hustle:Supplement your income to pay off debts or save for the future.Aim for financial independence and freedom.Remember, the possibilities are vast. The critical part is understanding where you want to improve, why, and the direction that makes the most sense for you.It all begins with the belief that you deserve this investment in yourself.Time to grow and thrive!2.) See yourself as a brandWe must see ourselves as a brand worthy of an excellent reputation, aiming for the respect enjoyed by iconic brands like Mercedes-Benz.But how do we earn this respect?Create Confidence, Not Doubt:Confidence is the key to performing our best under stress.Breed confidence by facing daily fears, maintaining the right mindset, reflecting on memories, and adjusting internal messaging.Project confidence without arrogance, setting an example for others.Know When to Speak:Silence attracts respect; it’s powerful and improves relations.Actions speak louder than words, and listening provides valuable knowledge.Use silence strategically, be comfortable with it, and avoid unnecessary noise.Speak only when it enhances silence.Endure Criticism:Criticism’s power lies in our reaction to it.Endure criticism without losing composure; it’s an opportunity for growth.Daily decisions: Let criticism outweigh the desire for success or let success overshadow the dents of criticism.Avoid Drama:Drama evaporates reputation; steer clear of it at all costs.Refuse gossip, winning trust and respect by being someone who rises above drama.In embracing these principles, we position ourselves as individuals deserving of admiration, fostering trust and respect from those around us.3.) At the end of each year, evaluateAudits guide us in pinpointing areas for improvement and assessing our life’s trajectory. Let’s delve into key areas:Health:Are we dedicating time to mental and physical well-being?Long-term success requires sustained effort.Reflect on physical care routines — exercise, stretching, meditation.Address emotions productively rather than burying them.Finances:Does financial standing align with happiness?Understand spending habits and identify potential investments.Avoid distractions; focus on proven financial strategies.Personal Development:Evaluate current skills and identify desired ones.Explore methods for acquiring new skills and clarify their importance.Relationships:Assess your social circle and its impact.Reflect on how time spent with certain individuals influences your feelings.Rate your overall relationship with yourself and understand why.Self-Care:Do we prioritize self-care?Identify activities that bring joy and assess if they’re part of your routine.Recognize obstacles preventing self-care.Home Life:Gauge quality time spent at home.Ensure presentness and establish boundaries between personal and professional life.Address factors hindering goal pursuit, such as excessive TV consumption.Bonus Questions:What changes would make the most significant impact on your life?The key is non-judgmental recognition, summarization, and identifying opportunities.Goal Setting:Categorize goals into health, finances, personal development, relationships, self-care, and home life.Ensure continual progress across all aspects of life.This process is not about judgment but about self-awareness, summarizing findings, and identifying growth opportunities.Thank you for reading.The next blog post will cover the remaining three rules.LifeRulesInvestingHealthSide Hustle----16FollowWritten by Wizdom10.5K FollowersRead or listen to bite-sized book summaries and podcasts in the first-of-its-kind Audio Immersive Experience with Wizdom! https://onelink.to/mwaskaFollowHelpStatusAboutCareersBlogPrivacyTermsText to speechTeams
