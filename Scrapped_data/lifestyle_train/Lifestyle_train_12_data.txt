Worrying, on the other hand, could lead you to unhappiness and resentment toward other people because you are relying on what you think. This is what we call overthinking.If we can deal with worrying and take action right away, we will be able to overcome the fear and obstacles that we face. We can achieve what we want in life and become the best version of ourselves when making decisions and working.So, to deal with worrying, you need to know certain things about why we worry too much to deal with the roots or the cause, which could lead us to disaster.You are worrying because you don‚Äôt know what the end is.We all wanted to know what would happen at the ending scene.At least we have some certainty that everything will go according to our plan. However, we tried to plan too much and then try to control what the end looked like.You didn‚Äôt know that, in the end, people could react differently to what you planned. You visualize, but still, there is no sign of what the end will be.This ended up being something we called anxiety and overthinking.You are worried because you are not sure where you‚Äôll be in the future.You know what you want in the future, but is it really going to be that way?You know what you plan for the future, but is it really going to be that way?You know what you envision for the future, but is it really going to be that way?Too much of this thinking actually leads to more worrying and anxiety. We became overthinking once again and didn‚Äôt really think straight about what the present moment is.We end up living in the future and forgetting the most about where we are right now.You are worrying because you don‚Äôt know what to do.Some disasters could happen at any time.Your job might be frustrating right now.Your business might not be making a profit right now.Your family might not be in their happiest moment right now.Even so, we are still figuring out what to do instead of saying yes to what has already happened.Not knowing what to do and being frustrated to figure it out actually ends up being worrying.Sometimes we can only let it happen today and focus on what we usually do. This is where you are trained to be more forgiving, let go of the things that have already been done, and just let them be.You are worrying too much about ‚ÄúWhat should I do now?‚Äù instead of really seeing the situation and just saying yes to it for a moment. I don‚Äôt ask you to just let it go if the world goes down, but at least take a moment to see the world or situation you are in right now.After you are in a peaceful state, you will know what you need to do rather than what you ‚Äòwant‚Äô to do.You are worrying because you are not in the ‚Äúright‚Äù place.You think that you are supposed to be somewhere else.You think that you are supposed to be rich right now.You think that you are working in the wrong place.You think that you are in the wrong environment.Where you are right now is actually part of progressing toward becoming someone better. You are set up in a certain place for a reason. God, always give us something that we don‚Äôt expect but that we actually need.Our own eyes can‚Äôt see it, but God knows what is right for you and what is not.This is why we end up controlling what we can‚Äôt control.We are human beings who can‚Äôt see the future or even go back to the past.We just live in this world, rented, in a world where it is not us who built it. Still, we are arrogantly trying to control what we can‚Äôt control and worrying about something that is not necessary to think of.This is where worrying ends up compounding and becoming depressing.Take a break from worrying about what you can‚Äôt control and live a little.Yes, you are right; we are not in the ‚Äúright‚Äù place sometimes.Maybe we are not in the best situation right now, but does it really matter to think about that all the time and worry too much?We live to live, not to think all the time.‚ÄúA person who thinks all the time has nothing to think about except thoughts. So, he loses touch with reality and lives in a world of illusions.‚Äù‚Äï Alan WattsThe more you are in touch with reality and just ‚Äòlive a little‚Äô in your life, you will know that you are doing fine.You might still be worrying about where you are right now rather than actually doing the thing you need to do.So, separate what you can control and what you can‚Äôt control. Let it be on what you can‚Äôt control and focus on what you can control, which is doing the thing.You are here to become better for God, you, your family, and the people in this world. You are born to become something that God created you to be.Are you willing to become the ultimate version of yourself that God has set for you?‚Äú‚Ä¶the point is, you can‚Äôt get so hung up on where you‚Äôd rather be that you forget to make the most of where you are.Take a break from worrying about what you can‚Äôt control.Live a little.‚Äù‚Äî From the movie ‚ÄòPassengers‚ÄôAbout MeTwitter: @ItsKevinNokiaInstagram: @Kevin_nokiaFREE Changing-Life Blueprint: Click hereFREE My Booknotes Template Out NOW: Grab one!Hey!
